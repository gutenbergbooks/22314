  immutable laws. Experience is acquired by the careful study of history,
  and the present condition of all things. All is governed now by that same
  law of truth, which was from the beginning of the world, and ever shall
  be. What serious lessons, then, may be learned by a careful examination
  of past ages; and how useful may they not be to us and our children for
  future ages? We can only judge of that which is to come hereafter, by
  studying the past, and carefully noting the present.</p>

<h2>MYSTICISM, AND ITS RESULTS.</h2>

<hr class="short" >

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Secrecy; its Uses and Abuses.&mdash;Mystery; its
  Definition.&mdash;Mysticism, and its Definition.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is not true, as has been sometimes said, that wherever there is
  secrecy there is error.</p>

  <p>Secrecy, like most all else, hath its uses and abuses: its uses, as
  developed in modesty and domestic virtue, in religious meditation,
  self-examination, and prayer, and in prudence in the affairs of life: its
  abuses, in prudery, asceticism, superstitious awe, undue veneration of
  power, and when used as a cloud to conceal crime so hideous that nothing
  but the truth of God, vindicated by human laws founded thereon, directed
  by wisdom, can dispel it.</p>

  <p>Virtue and modesty shrink from public gaze. Each looks alone to its
  innate sense, the gift of God, and to the sole approval of the great "I
  <span class="scac">AM</span>."</p>

  <p>The hidden sincere aspirations of the heart are known only to Him who
  "breathed into man the <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>[10]</span>breath of life, and he became a living
  soul." These are a secret between the created being and its Almighty
  Father. At the lonely hour, when the burdened soul, knowing no earthly
  refuge from overwhelming troubles, but a mightier Hand than that of man,
  seeks on bended knee and with penitential tear, a blessing from on high,
  no word is spoken, no sound uttered save the sob from a contrite heart.
  The aspiration has gone forth inaudibly to Him who said to all mankind,
  then and for future ages, "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
  laden and I will give you rest."<a name="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,</p>
      <p>Uttered or unexpressed,</p>
      <p>The motion of a hidden fire</p>
      <p>That trembles in the breast.</p>
      <p>It is the burden of a sigh,</p>
      <p>The falling of a tear,</p>
      <p>The upward glancing of an eye</p>
      <p>When none but God is near."<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>What knoweth the outer world of this? Yet wrong can not exist in such
  secret communion between a penitent heart and its Maker. Pure religious
  meditation, leading us from earth to heaven, is only promoted by secret
  study and reflection in solitude. Neither philosophy nor religion can be
  cultivated in the midst of the vortices of commerce or other business
  requiring constant intercourse with hundreds of <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[11]</span>men during the day, nor
  in the whirl of fashion in the evening.</p>

  <p>Thus, then, do we trace one of the uses of secrecy. Both its use and
  its abuse we shall hereinafter find exemplified in marked effects not
  only on individual minds, but also on the masses of mankind in past
  history: its use, in the development of true piety: its abuse, in
  asceticism, superstition, and overweening spiritual power resulting in
  crimes, which were "a sin unto death." Another abuse of secrecy has been
  manifested in means heretofore employed in the constant effort to obtain
  and maintain worldly power. This was by affecting the imagination and
  blinding the reason of the masses. Some time ago, an ephemeral work was
  published, even the name of which is not recollected by this writer,
  wherein was a picture showing the section of a handsome tent with
  curtains closely drawn. Within, is a man eating and feasting like other
  mortals. Without, is a stand on which are exposed to view the usual
  emblems and insignia of royalty, before which there is a kneeling crowd.
  An admirable illustration! True it is, that "no man is a hero to his
  valet-de-chambre." Fashionable wealth and power depend upon exclusiveness
  to accomplish their usual attendant influences. Royalty hides every hour
  in secrecy from public gaze, except when it occasionally becomes
  necessary to treat the subjects to a mere pageant or show of military
  costume and outside appearances. When Lola Montes displayed to <!-- Page
  12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>[12]</span>the world the
  mere humanity of the old king of Bavaria, where had he any
  <i>prestige</i> left? Schamyl has attained his extraordinary influence
  and power by his seclusion, asceticism, and pretended revelations; and
  bravery having crowned his efforts, he is a favorite of fortune, and the
  idol of a superstitious veneration. What did not Mohammed accomplish in
  the same manner? But, in illustration of the opposite effect, so well
  known to the sad experience of all, hath not a mightier One testified
  that, "a prophet hath no honor in his own country?"<a name="NtA_3"
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But doth not also common prudence in worldly affairs demand the use of
  secrecy?</p>

  <p>What good general will detail, even to his own forces, and still less
  make public for the use of his adversary, his plans and intentions for an
  ensuing campaign?&mdash;what business man communicate to the public or to
  his rivals his hard thought and well-planned speculation?&mdash;what
  inventor publish his new machine or discovery until he has secured his
  patent-right?</p>

  <p>In what follows, then, let us discriminate between the use and abuse
  of secrecy; so that, by the lessons of the past and the present, we may
  be safely guided in our course through the future.</p>

  <p>Before going into matters of historic detail, it were well to
  understand the definition of the word "mystery." <!-- Page 13 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>[13]</span></p>

  <p>Many suppose it to mean "something which is incomprehensible." This is
  all a mistake.</p>

  <p>"<span title="Mustêrion" class="grk"
  >&Mu;&upsilon;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>" means
  simply "a revealed secret." In other words, "mystery," which we derive
  from the Greek word quoted, means neither more nor less than a secret
  revealed and explained to us. A man of mature years and finished
  education knows that which no school-boy can comprehend. To the elder a
  secret has been revealed. He is in possession of the mystery. To the
  younger it is yet a secret, not incomprehensible, but which can only be
  attained in the progress of learning. To the scientific many of the
  mysteries of nature are unfolded, but they are a secret to the world at
  large. To those Christians in the earlier days of the church, who had
  attained its highest instruction, and after the "Ite, missa est" had
  dismissed the rest of the congregation, remained to participate in the
  "pure offering" (or "clean oblation") prophesied by Malachi<a
  name="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> to be thereafter offered in
  every place to Him whose name thenceforth should be great among the
  Gentiles&mdash;to them "it was given to know the mysteries of God:"<a
  name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> not to understand things
  incomprehensible. That would be a contradiction in terms: a thing
  impossible. How can a person comprehend that which passeth all
  understanding? But it may be said, there are things which are
  incomprehensible. Not so. They may be a secret to us while, in this
  school-house, the earth, the <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>[14]</span>pedagogue Necessity is teaching us only the
  rudiments of the laws of God as developed in nature or in mind; but, when
  the <i>scintilla divinitatis</i>, hidden in these "earthen vessels,"<a
  name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> shall have been set free,
  and (while "the dust returns to the earth as it was") rises unto Him that
  breathed into us that "spiritus" or "breath of life"&mdash;when we shall
  hereafter have been "newly born" into a spiritual state of higher
  existence&mdash;then may we hope that what is secret to us now, may
  become a mystery or revealed secret to us hereafter. It is not all of
  life to terminate our existence on this earth. This is but the
  school-house in the commencement of eternity. These mysteries, now
  secrets to us, are created and maintained by the fixed laws of Him "who
  is without variableness or shadow of turning." The revelations thereof
  belong to a higher kingdom, which "flesh and blood can not inherit," yet
  in which every soul "shall be made alive."<a name="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> Then shall these secrets be unfolded in
  proportion to the cultivation of the mind and talents here: for the
  unchangeable laws of God have placed all matter in constant and regular
  mutation; and whether of matter or of mind, all is governed by a certain
  law of progress, compelling us to attain excellence and strength only by
  constant endeavors to surmount difficulties: and it is thus alone we can,
  by severe study and deep meditation, in investigating these laws of
  mutation and progress in things physical and <!-- Page 15 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>[15]</span>moral, bring the mind,
  even in this life, to a nearer approximation to, and capability of,
  appreciating the wonderful truths we must hereafter learn. As in all
  other laws of God, the cultivation of our talents must then carry its
  proportionate reward hereafter.<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Let us then examine into the uses and abuses of secrecy in past
  history, and at the present day&mdash;but more particularly will these be
  manifested by "<span class="sc">Mysticism</span>;" by which is meant,
  <i>the revelation of learning, social, religious, and political, the
  teaching of which has been, and is, preserved secret from the world, by
  societies, associations, and confraternities</i>.<a name="NtA_9"

</blockquote>

  <p>In a critical study of the books of Moses two eras seem to be
  discernible. The earlier, the Elohistic, when God was only known by the
  name, "Elohim." The latter, the "Jehovahstic," beginning at a later
  period.<a name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Though not altogether germain to our subject, may we here be permitted
  to inquire&mdash;<i>par parenthese</i>&mdash;whether this simple rule
  does not furnish to us the means of reconciliation of apparent
  contradictions?</p>

  <p>All instruction originally was traditional alone. The patriarch was
  priest and teacher, as well as ruler of his tribe. Each handed down to
  his successor the <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>[17]</span>traditions he had received from his
  ancestors orally. As tribes became nomadic, or else sought permanently
  new settlements and homes, traditions in course of time necessarily
  became variant. Moses seems honestly to have collated these traditions,
  and has, no doubt, given them in their respective versions as he received
  them from Jethro, his father-in-law, and from the patriarchal instruction
  among the elders of his people in Egypt. Thus we can recognize those in
  which the name Elohim is used as being of much earlier date than the same
  tradition differently told, where the word Jehovah indicates the name of
  Deity. For instance, we find in one place<a name="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> the command of God to Noah to take the
  beasts and fowls, &amp;c., into the ark by sevens. But again, in the same
  chapter,<a name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> we find them
  taken only by pairs. Are these not variant traditions of one event? So,
  of the story of Abraham passing off his wife for his sister before <span
  class="correction" title="text reads `Pharoah'">Pharaoh</span>, king of
  Egypt,<a name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and also before
  Abimelech, king of Gerar,<a name="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> and the farther tradition of Isaac and
  Rebecca having done the same thing before Abimelech, king of Gerar.<a
  name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Are not these variant
  traditions of one fact? The legal experience of the writer for many
  years, convinces him that no two persons without collusion view a
  transaction generally exactly alike. Frequently&mdash;and each equally
  sincere and honest&mdash;they widely vary in their testimony. <!-- Page
  18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>[18]</span>Collusion may
  produce a story without contradiction. Slight discrepancies show there is
  no fraud, only that the witnesses occupied different stand points, or
  gave more or less attention to what was the subject matter.</p>

  <p>But, asking pardon for this digression, let us return to our
  theme.</p>

  <p>We know little or nothing about the teaching of the patriarchs in the
  Elohistic age. Neither writing nor sculpture thereof existed in the time
  of Moses, except, perhaps, the lost book of Enoch, or, unless&mdash;which
  we are inclined to doubt&mdash;the book of Job had just before his era
  been reduced to writing by the Idumean, Assyrian, or Chaldean priesthood.
  We find at that period that sacrifices were offered on mountain tops.
  Why? Abraham went to such a place to offer up his son. Was it not for
  secrecy in the religious rite? If the earliest instruction was from God,
  whose truth is unchangeable and eternal, were not the earliest sacrifices
  offered in secret by reason of the same command which subsequently
  obliged the high priest of his chosen people to offer the great sacrifice
  in secret within the veils, first of the Tabernacle, afterward of the
  Temple? The Elohistic age ended with the first official act of Moses,
  after he, also, had met with Aaron on "the mount of God."<a name="NtA_16"
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A new era then commenced. As men dispersed <!-- Page 19 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[19]</span>themselves over the
  earth, the original belief in the one true God (Monotheism) was lost, and
  people fell into the worship of many deities (Polytheism), adoring the
  visible works of creation, more particularly the sun and the stars of
  heaven, or else reverencing the operative powers of nature as divine
  beings. Faith in the one Great <span class="sc">Jehovah</span> was
  preserved by the children of Israel alone. Idols were erected within
  gorgeous temples. With the Chaldean, Ph&oelig;nician, and Assyrian,
  Moloch began the dreadful cruelty of human sacrifices, chiefly of
  children. If, at first, the image of the idol was only a visible symbol
  of a spiritual conception, or of an invisible power, this higher meaning
  was lost in progress of time in the minds of most nations, and they came
  at length to pay worship to the lifeless image itself. The priests alone
  were acquainted with any deeper meaning, but refused to share it with the
  people; they reserved it under the veil of esoteric (secret) doctrines,
  as the peculiar appanage of their own class. They invented endless fables
  which gave rise to Mythology. They ruled the people by the might of
  superstition, and acquired wealth, honor, and power, for themselves.<a
  name="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> We arrive then at nearly
  the culminating point of Egyptian priestcraft, the days of "wise men,"
  "sorcerers," and "magicians."<a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Such men ever <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>[20]</span>have, and we presume ever
  will employ secrecy as the chief element of their clever jugglery.
  Mankind love to be deceived. Let an Adrian, Blitz, or
  Alexander&mdash;while they tell you, and you well know it, that their
  tricks are a deception&mdash;put forth notices of an exhibition, and they
  will attract crowds, where an Arago, or a Faraday, would not be listened
  to. Maelzel's automata, or Vaucanson's duck, will attract the world, when
  Bacon's, or Newton's, or Laplace's works may remain in dust on the
  book-shelves. Human nature is always the same, and thus it was in the
  days of Moses and Pharaoh. The wise men, sorcerers, and magicians, held
  undisputed sway, not only over the superstitions of the people, but over
  their educated monarchs and princes. Egypt possessed, at an inconceivably
  early period, numberless towns and villages, and a high amount of
  civilization. Arts, sciences, and civil professions, were cherished
  there, so that the Nile-land has generally been regarded as the
  mysterious cradle of human culture; but the system of castes checked free
  development and continuous improvement. Everything subserved a gloomy
  religion and a powerful priesthood, who held the people in terror and
  superstition. Their doctrine, that, after the death of man, the soul
  could not enter into her everlasting repose unless the body were
  preserved, occasioned the singular custom of embalming the corpses of the
  departed to preserve them from decay, and of treasuring them up in the
  shape of <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>[21]</span>mummies in shaft-like passages and mortuary
  chambers. Through this belief, the priests, who, as judges of the dead,
  possessed the power of giving up the bodies of the sinful to corruption,
  and by this means occasioning the transmigration of their souls into the
  bodies of animals, obtained immense authority. Notwithstanding the
  magnificence of their architectural productions, and the vast technical
  skill and dexterity in sculpture and mechanical appliances which they
  display, the Egyptians have produced but little in literature or the
  sciences; and even this little was locked up from the people in the
  mysterious hieroglyphical writing, which was understood by the priests
  alone.<a name="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> The following
  translation is a quotation from a Latin work: "Among the ancient
  Egyptians, from whom we learn the rudiments of speech, besides the three
  common kinds of letters, other descriptions of characters are used which
  have been generally consecrated to their peculiar mysteries. In a
  dissertation on this subject, that celebrated antiquarian (<i>conditor
  stromatum</i>), Clement, of Alexandria, teaches in his writings, thus:
  'Those who are taught Egyptian, first, indeed, learn the grammar and
  chirography called letter-writing, that is, which is apt for ordinary
  correspondence; secondly, however, that used by the priests, called
  sacred writing, to commemorate sacred things; the last also,
  hieroglyphic, meaning sacred sculpture, one of the first elements of
  which is <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>[22]</span>cyriologism, meaning, properly speaking,
  enunciating truth by one or another symbol, or in other words, portraying
  the meaning by significant emblems.' With Clement agrees the Arabian,
  Abenephi, who uses this language: (This Arabic writing is preserved in
  the Vatican library, but not as yet printed: it is often quoted by
  Athanasius Kircher, in his Treatise on the Pamphilian Obelisk, whence
  these and other matters stated by us have been taken.) 'But there were
  four kinds of writing among the Egyptians: First, that in use among the
  populace and the ignorant; secondly, that in vogue among the philosophers
  and the educated; thirdly, one compounded of letters and symbols, without
  drawn figures or representations of things; the fourth was confined
  solely to the priesthood, the figures or letters of which were those of
  birds, by which they represented the sacred things of Deity.' From which
  last testimony we learn that erudite Egyptians used a peculiar and
  different system of writing from that of the populace, and it was for the
  purpose of teaching their peculiar doctrines. For example, they show that
  this writing consisted of symbols, partly of opinions and ideas, partly
  of historic fables accommodated to a more secret method of teaching. But
  Clement, of Alexandria, went further. In book v. of Antiquities
  (<i>stromata</i>, 'foundation of things'), he says: 'All who controlled
  theological matters, Barbarian as well as Greek, have concealed their
  principles, hiding the truth in enigmas, signs, symbols, as <!-- Page 23
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[23]</span>well as
  allegories, and also in tropes, and have handed them down in various
  symbols and methods.'"<a name="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
  This passage led subsequently to the brilliant discoveries of
  Champollion.</p>

  <p>Who, then, were the "erudite Egyptians" who used a peculiar system of
  writing" for the purpose of teaching their peculiar doctrines?" Who were
  <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>[24]</span>these "magi," "wise men," "sorcerers," and
  "magicians"? Nowhere do we find Pharaoh in the midst of his troubles
  calling for a priest. It is always for the wise men, magicians, and
  sorcerers. Were they not the priests?&mdash;were they not those who
  controlled the mysteries&mdash;who practised divination? When Moses and
  Aaron cast down their rods, the magicians of Egypt "also did in like
  manner with their enchantments," and the result was the same.<a
  name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> When Moses smote the
  waters that they became blood, the acuteness of the priests, or magi, in
  their mysteries taught them a lesson whereby they were able to do the
  same.<a name="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> When the frogs
  came up on Pharaoh and on all his people, and on all his servants, and
  covered the land of Egypt, we learn "the magicians did so with their
  enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt."<a
  name="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> If the ancient Egyptians
  were like their descendants, it is singular the magi could not accomplish
  the next plague, that is, of lice. But here their power ended. The magi
  originated in Media. According to oriental custom, to them was intrusted
  the preservation of scientific knowledge, and the performance of the holy
  exercises of Religion. Afterward, in a special sense, the magi were a
  caste of priests of the Medes and Persians, deriving the name of Pehlvi;
  Mag, or Mog, generally signifies in that language, <i>a priest</i>. They
  are expressly mentioned by Herodotus as a Median tribe. Zoroaster was not
  their founder, <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>[25]</span>but was their reformer, and the purifier of
  their doctrines. The Magi of his time were opposed to his innovations;
  and they, therefore, were condemned by him. When afterward, however, they
  adopted his reforms, he effected their thorough organization, dividing
  them into <span class="sc">Apprentices</span>, <span
  class="sc">Masters</span>, and <span class="sc">Perfect Masters</span>.
  Their study and science consisted in observation of their holy rites, in
  the knowledge of their sacred forms of prayer, and liturgies by which
  Ormuzd was worshipped, and in the ceremonies attendant on their prayers
  and sacrifices. They only were permitted to act as mediators between God
  and man. To them alone was the will of God declared. They only could
  penetrate the future. And they alone predicted the future to those who
  sought of them therefor. In later days the name Magi became synonymous
  with sorcerer, magician, alchemist, &amp;c.<a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>[26]</span></p>

  <p>The magi of Egypt were the priests, the founders and preservers of the
  mysteries of the secret grades of instruction, and of the hieratic and
  hieroglyphic writings and sculptures. In secret they were the priesthood.
  In public, in religious matters, the same. But in public secular affairs
  they seem to be recognised as Magi.</p>

  <p>When mythology was invented, most of the gods, if not all of them,
  were received as symbolical, physical beings, the poets made of them
  moral agents; and as such they appear in the religions of the people of
  earlier days. The symbolical meaning would have been lost, if no means
  had been provided to insure its preservation. The <span
  class="scac">MYSTERIES</span>, it seems, afforded such means. Their great
  end, therefore, was to preserve the knowledge of the peculiar attributes
  of those divinities which had been incorparated into the popular religion
  under new forms; what powers and objects of nature they represented; how
  these, and how the universe came into being; in a word, cosmogonies, like
  those contained in the Orphic instructions. But this knowledge, though it
  was preserved by oral instruction, was perpetuated no less by <!-- Page
  27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>[27]</span>symbolic
  representations and usages; which, at least in part, consisted of sacred
  traditions and fables. "In the sanctuary of Sais," says Herodotus (l.c.),
  "representations are given by night of the adventures of the goddess; and
  these are called by the Egyptians <i>mysteries</i>; of which, however, I
  will relate no more. It was thence that these mysteries were introduced
  into Greece."<a name="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> The
  temples of India and of Egypt seem to be identical in architecture and in
  sculpture.<a name="NtA_26" href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> Both nations
  seem to have sprung from the old Assyrian stock.<a name="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> The magi of both countries appear to
  have had a common origin; and their teachings must have been, therefore,
  traditionally the same. We may, then, presume that there were three
  grades in the instructions of these mysteries, by whatever name they may
  have been called&mdash;whether Apprentices, Masters, and Perfect Masters,
  or otherwise; that they were sacred in their character; and that their
  symbolic meanings were revealed in these <span
  class="sc">Mysteries</span>, and in no other manner, while they were kept
  a secret from the world at large. But this was not all. They spread, with
  emigration and commerce, into all then known countries. Their common
  origin, or at least that of most of them, is still perceptible. <span
  class="sc">Ceres</span> had long wandered over the earth, before she was
  received at Eleusis, and erected there her <!-- Page 28 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[28]</span>sanctuary. (Isocrat.
  Paneg. op., p. 46, ed. Steph., and many other places in Meursii Eleusin.,
  cap. 1.) Her secret service in the Thesmophoria, according to the account
  of Herodotus (iv. 172), was first introduced by Danaus; who brought it
  from Egypt to the Peloponnesus.<a name="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> One writer says that mysteries were,
  among the Greeks, and afterward also among the Romans, secret religious
  assemblies, which no uninitiated person was permitted to approach. They
  originated at a very early period. They were designed to interpret those
  mythological fables and religious rites, the true meaning of which it was
  thought expedient to conceal from the people. They were perhaps necessary
  in those times, in which the superstitions, the errors, and the
  prejudices of the people, could not be openly exposed without danger to
  the public peace. Upon this ground they were tolerated and protected by
  the state. Their first and fundamental law was a profound secrecy. In all
  mysteries there were dramatic exhibitions, relating to the exploits of
  the deities in whose honor they were celebrated.<a name="NtA_29"
  href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> We may thus trace all ancient pagan
  religion to a common origin, with similarity of human means to accomplish
  a general result, variant in name, or in practice, as to the deity, or
  form of its worship, but resting on a unity as to its commencement and
  its object.</p>

<p><!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[29]</span></p>

  <p>We can hardly penetrate the veil which hides from us the pagan worship
  of that early human stock the race of Ham, which&mdash;without the divine
  light granted only to the Israelites&mdash;was the origin of false
  worship. We can only arrive at conclusions, but these are the result of
  strong presumptions arising from undisputed historical facts. What are
  they?</p>

  <p>One of the principal chiefs of the earliest race, whence came the
  magi, &amp;c., was Nimrod, afterward deified by the name of Bel to the
  Chaldeans, Baal to the Hebrews, <span title="Bêlos" class="grk"
  >&Beta;&eta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> to the Greeks, and Belus to
  the Romans; and when, in later days, statues received adoration (which at
  first was only accorded to the being of whom the statue was a type), he
  became worshipped under a multiplication of statues, they were in the
  Hebrew language called "Baalim," or the plural of Baal. Nimrod was the
  son of Cush, grandson of Ham, and great-grandson of Noah. "And Cush begat
  Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter
  before the Lord: wherefore it is said, 'Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter
  before the Lord.' And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech,
  and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. And out of that land he
  went forth to Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and
  Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city."<a
  name="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> While, then, <!-- Page 30
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[30]</span>the children of
  Shem and Japheth pursued the patriarchal course, and preserved the
  ancient traditions subsequently handed down, the descendants of Ham,
  suffering under the patriarchal malediction of Noah, built cities
  composed of families, and a great kingdom composed of cities and nations.
  This kingdom was the origin of pagan worship. They lost the patriarchal
  traditions, and were the first to establish on this earth the
  concentration of power in a political system. That power once attained,
  the daring energy of the king became in the hand of the priesthood a
  subject of deification for two reasons. 1. The king was mortal, and must
  die. 2. The power must be preserved. When afterward, under Peleg, this
  race, at their <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>[31]</span>building of Ba-Bel&mdash;their temple of
  Bel&mdash;became dispersed, and left to us only their ruin of that
  temple, now called <i>Birs Nimroud</i>, the magi, or priests, preserved
  the power he attained to themselves, by means of secrecy in their
  mysteries, and which were dispersed subsequently through the earth in
  different languages and forms, varying with the poetry and climate of the
  country or countries thereafter occupied, and adapted from time to time
  to the existing exigencies of the times. Thence sprang the origin of
  mythologies, or, in other words, fabulous histories of the fructifying
  energies of Nature, whether developed in the germination of the vegetable
  kingdom, or in an occasional poetical version of some heroic act of one
  in power.</p>

  <p>This nation, the old Assyrian, became dispersed at the destruction of
  their great temple. But their political power everywhere was mysteriously
  preserved. When the magi became organized in Media, they spread in every
  direction. From earliest days we find their worship amid the nations
  conquered by Joshua. We see them in the traces of the <span title="Oi Poimenes" class="grk"
  >&Omicron;&#x1F30;
  &Pi;&omicron;&iota;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>, or
  shepherd-kings of Egypt, and in the sorcerers of the days of Moses. We,
  find them reformed by Zoroaster in Persia. They are conspicuous among the
  Greeks, who derived their mysteries from Egypt; and in the worship of
  Isis at Rome, never indigenous there. And even in later days (those of
  Darius, Belshazzar, and Cyrus), they seem to be thoroughly <!-- Page 32
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>[32]</span>re-established
  in their original birthplace. And, strange as it may appear, we find
  their power over kings, generals, nations, and people, in the hands of
  the priesthood, by means of their mysteries, from all early history,
  until affected by the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>Regarding, then, the off-shoot from patriarchal tradition to be the
  origin of pagan worship; referring also to the first formation of cities,
  and of one immense kingdom, by the descendants of Ham (accursed by his
  prophetic ancestor), by whom an empire was first established; to Nimrod's
  deification; to the preservation in the priesthood of future political
  power; to the fact that after his death they would and might thereby
  perpetuate the same; that wherever thereafter dispersed, they did so by
  their revelations by mysteries, in which they controlled not only the
  masses of the people, but those who governed them, in whatsoever nation
  then known&mdash;we arrive at the conclusion that the mysteries were the
  elements of religious and consequently of political power.</p>

  <p>The important Greek mysteries, of the details whereof we know most,
  were&mdash;1. The <i>Eleusinian</i>. 2. The <i>Samothracian</i>, which
  originated in Crete and Phrygia, and were celebrated in the former
  country in honor of Jupiter. From these countries they were introduced
  among the Thracians or Pelasgians in the island of Samothrace, and
  extended thence into Greece. They were sometimes celebrated in honor <!--
  Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>[33]</span>of
  Jupiter, sometimes of Bacchus, and sometimes of Ceres. 3. The
  <i>Dionysia</i>, which were brought from Thrace to Thebes, and were very
  similar to the former. They were celebrated every second year. The
  transition of men from barbarism to civilization was likewise represented
  in them. The women were clothed in skins of beasts. With a spear
  (<i>thyrsus</i>), bound with ivy, in their hands, they ascended Mount
  Cithæron; when, after the religious ceremonies, wild dances were
  performed, which ended with the dispersion of the priestesses and the
  initiated in the neighboring woods. They had also symbols, chiefly
  relating to Bacchus, who was the hero of these mysteries. These
  celebrations were forbidden in Thebes, even in the time of Epaminondas,
  and afterward in all Greece, as prejudicial to the public peace and
  morals. 4. The <i>Orphic</i>, chiefly deserving mention as the probable
  foundation of the Eleusinian. 5. The mysteries of Isis, not in vogue in
  Greece, but very popular in Rome.<a name="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> The offspring of Egyptian priestcraft,
  they were instituted with a view to aggrandize that order of men, to
  extend their influence, and enlarge their revenues. To accomplish these
  selfish projects, they applied every engine toward besotting the
  multitude with superstition and enthusiasm. They taught them to believe
  that they were the distinguished favorites of Heaven; that celestial
  doctrines had been revealed to them, too holy to be communicated to the
  profane <!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page34"></a>[34]</span>rabble, and too sublime to be comprehended
  by vulgar capacities. Princes and legislators, who found their advantage
  in overawing and humbling the multitude, readily adopted a plan so
  artfully fabricated to answer these purposes. The views of those in power
  were congenial with those of the priests, and both united in the same
  spirit to thus control the respect, admiration, and dependence, of the
  million.</p>

  <p>They made their disciples believe that in the next world the souls of
  the uninitiated should roll in mire and dirt, and with difficulty reach
  their destined mansion. Hence, Plato introduces Socrates as observing
  that "the sages who introduced the Teletæ had positively affirmed that
  whatever soul should arrive in the infernal mansions <i>unhouselled</i>
  and <i>unannealed</i> should lie there immersed in mire and
  filth."&mdash;"And as to a future state," says Aristides, "the initiated
  shall not roll in mire and grope in darkness, a fate which awaits the
  unholy and uninitiated." When the Athenians advised Diogenes to be
  initiated, "It will be pretty enough," replied he, "to see Agesilaus and
  Epaminondas wallowing in the mire, while the most contemptible rascals
  who have been initiated are strolling in the islands of bliss!" When
  Antisthenes was to be initiated, and the priests were boasting of the
  wonderful benefit to ensue, "Why, forsooth, 'tis wonder your reverence
  don't hang yourself, in order to come at it sooner," was his remark.
  When, however, such benefits were expected to be derived from the <!--
  Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>[35]</span>mysteries, it is no wonder the world crowded
  to the Eleusinian standard. Initiation was, in reality, a consecration to
  Ceres and Proserpine. Its result was, honor and reverence from the
  masses. They believed all virtue to be inspired by these goddesses.
  Pericles says: "I am convinced that the deities of Eleusis inspired me
  with this sentiment, and that this stratagem was suggested by the
  principle of the mystic rites." So also Aristophanes makes the chorus of
  the initiated, in his Ranæ, to sing:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Let us to flowery mead repair,</p>
      <p>With deathless roses blooming,</p>
      <p>Whose balmy sweets impregn the air,</p>
      <p>Both hills and dales perfuming.</p>
      <p>Since fate benign one choir has joined,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is believed that the higher orders of magi went further, and
  pretended to hold intercourse with, and cause to appear, the very <span
  title="eidôlon" class="grk"

  <p>It was a very general opinion, in later days, that demons had power
  over the souls of the dead, until Christ descended into Hades and
  delivered them from the thrall of the "Prince of Darkness." The dead were
  sometimes raised by those who did not possess a familiar spirit. These
  consulters repaired to the grave at night, and there lying down, repeated
  certain words in a low, muttering tone, and the spirit thus summoned
  appeared. "And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the

  <p>The celebrated Heeren, in his "Politics of Ancient Greece" (ch. iii.,
  p. 67, Am. ed.), remarks, in reference to the mysteries of Eleusis, that
  they exhibited the superiority of civilized over savage life, and gave
  instructions respecting a future life and its nature. For what was this
  more than an interpretation of the sacred traditions which were told of
  the goddess as the instructress in agriculture, of the forced descent of
  her daughter to the lower world, etc.? And we need not be more astonished
  if, in some of their sacred rites, we perceive an excitement carried to a
  degree of enthusiastic madness which belonged peculiarly to the East, but
  which the Hellenes were very willing to receive. For we must not neglect
  to bear in mind that they shared the spirit of the East; and did they not
  live on the very boundary-line between the East and the West? As those
  institutions were propagated farther to the west, they lost their
  original character. We know what the Bacchanalian rites became at Rome;
  and had they been introduced north of the Alps, what form would they have
  there assumed? But to those countries it was possible to <!-- Page 39
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>[39]</span>transplant the
  vine, not the service of the god to whom the vine was sacred. The orgies
  of Bacchus suited the cold soil and inclement forests of the North as
  little as the character of its inhabitants.</p>

  <p>Without going further into detail (the minutiæ of which are thus
  opened to every scholar), we must presume that the mythology of the
  children of Ham, the origin of pagan worship, fostered by variant
  mysteries to obtain and maintain temporal power, spread itself through
  the then known world. So far as we know, the secret doctrines which were
  taught in the mysteries may have finally degenerated into mere forms and
  an unmeaning ritual. And yet the mysteries exercised a great influence on
  the spirit of the nation, not of the initiated only, but also on the
  great mass of the people; and perhaps they influenced the latter still
  more than the former. They preserved the reverence for sacred things, and
  this gave them their political importance. They produced that effect
  better than any modern secret societies have been able to do. The
  mysteries had their secrets, but not everything connected with them was
  secret. They had, like those of Eleusis, their public festivals,
  processions, and pilgrimages, in which none but the initiated took a
  part, but of which no one was prohibited from being a spectator. While
  the multitude was permitted to gaze at them, it learned to believe that
  there was something sublimer than anything with which it was acquainted,
  revealed only to the initiated; and <!-- Page 40 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>[40]</span>while the worth of that
  sublimer knowledge did not consist in secrecy alone, it did not lose any
  of its value by being concealed. Thus the popular religion and the secret
  doctrines, although always distinguished from each other, united in
  serving to curb the people. The condition and the influence of religion
  on a nation were always closely connected with the situation of those
  persons who were particularly appointed for the service of the gods, the
  priests. The scholar will readily call to mind a Calchas, a Chryses, and
  others. The leaders and commanders themselves, in those days, offered
  their sacrifices (see the description which Nestor makes to Pallas, Od.
  iii., 430, &amp;c.), performed the prayers, and observed the signs which
  indicated the result of an undertaking. In a word, kings and leaders were
  at the same time <span class="scac">PRIESTS</span>.<a name="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

  <p>How far may this have been a reason why Pharaoh did not call on a
  priest for help, but rely on the supposed superior knowledge of the Magi?
  a higher grade of secret instruction, perhaps, than he had received.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So far as the children of Shem and Japheth are concerned, it is
  believed true religion was preserved, except where tradition became
  adulterated with extraneous matter. And for the preservation of that
  religion, Almighty God, in his mercy, established of that lineage a
  certain race, with rules, partly signifying his truth, partly merely
  political, which should thereafter shine as a moral light to the world,
  no matter how dim the light might be, through the imperfection of human
  nature under peculiar circumstances of temptation or otherwise.</p>

  <p>Here, at once, was an antagonism with the pagan religion, which was of
  the children of Ham, under his father's patriarchal curse.</p>

  <p>When Moses, the servant with the watchword, "<span class="sc">I am
  that i am</span>," presented himself to the Shemitic and <!-- Page 42
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>[42]</span>Japhetic races,
  he was everywhere received and acknowledged by them as their leader, in
  opposition to both the temporal and theological power of the Magi and of
  Pharaoh.</p>

  <p>Here came the clashing between pagan and traditional theology
  preserved by the patriarchs. And Almighty God, to show the truth of his
  laws, sanctioned their promulgation by signs and miracles, which the Magi
  could not equal nor counteract.</p>

  <p>Pass by the Israelitish history until the loss and destruction of the
  first temple, when we find this religious race, although imbued with the
  principles of truth, fallen from their high estate, and led captive into
  a strange land, subject to the very people that insisted on the opposite
  of their own religion. They were then under the control of a monarch who
  was governed by the laws of the Medes and Persians, that is, of the Magi;
  and who, in turn, relied upon their emperor, who trusted only to his
  magicians, sorcerers, and Chaldeans. They were in <span
  class="sc">Babylon</span> itself.</p>

  <p>To confirm what has been said, and to elucidate what is to follow, we
  will pause a moment to learn what is meant by "the Chaldeans."</p>

  <p>The accounts that have been transmitted to us by the Chaldeans
  themselves of the antiquity of their learning, are blended with fable,
  and involved in considerable uncertainty. At the time when Callisthenes
  was requested by Aristotle to gain information concerning the origin of
  science in Chaldea, he was <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>[43]</span>informed that the ancestors of the Chaldeans
  had continued their astronomical observations through a period of 470,000
  years; but upon examining the ground of this report, he found that the
  Chaldean observation reached no further backward than 1,903 years, or
  that, of course (adding this number to 331, B.C., the year in which
  Babylon was taken by Alexander), they had commenced in the year 2,234,
  B.C. Besides, Ptolemy mentions no Chaldean observations prior to the era
  of Nabonassar, which commenced 747 years B.C. Aristotle, however, on the
  credit of the most ancient records, speaks of the Chaldean Magi as prior
  to the Egyptian priests, who, it is well known, cultivated learning
  before the time of Moses. It appears probable that the philosophers of
  Chaldea were the priests of the Babylonian nation, who instructed the
  people in the principles of religion, interpreted its laws, and conducted
  its ceremonies. Their character was similar to that of the Persian Magi,
  and they are often confounded by the Greek historians. Like the priests
  in most other nations, they employed religion in subserviency to the
  ruling powers, and made use of imposture to serve the purposes of civil
  policy. Accordingly Diodorus Siculus relates (lib. ii., p. 31, compared
  with Daniel ii. 1, &amp;c., Eccles. xliv. 3) that they pretended to
  predict future events by divination, to explain prodigies, interpret
  dreams, and avert evils or confer benefits by means of augury and
  incantations. For many ages they <!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page44"></a>[44]</span>retained a principal place among diviners.
  In the reign of Marcus Antoninus, when the emperor and his army, who were
  perishing with thirst, were suddenly relieved by a shower, the prodigy
  was ascribed to the power and skill of the Chaldean soothsayers. Thus
  accredited for their miraculous powers, they maintained their consequence
  in the courts of princes. (See Cic. de Divin. l. i., Strabo l.
  xv.&mdash;Sext. Emp. adv. Matt. l. v. § 2, Aul. Gell. l. xiv. s. 1,
  Strabo l.c.) The mysteries of Chaldean philosophy were revealed only to a
  select few, and studiously concealed from the multitude; and thus a veil
  of sanctity was cast over their doctrine, so that it might more easily
  <span class="correction" title="text reads `he'">be</span> employed in
  the support of civil and religious tyranny. The sum of the Chaldean
  cosmogony, as it is given in Syncellus (Chronic. p. 28), divested of
  allegory is, that in the beginning all things consisted of darkness and
  water; that <span class="sc">Belus</span>, or a divine power, dividing
  this humid mass formed the world, and that the <span class="correction"
  title="text reads `humid'">human</span> mind is an emanation from the
  divine nature. (Perizon. in Orig. Bab. Voss. de Scient. Math. c. xxx. §
  5. Hottinger Hist. Or. p. 365. Herbelot Bib. Or. Voc. Zor. Anc. Un. Hist.
  vol. iii. Prid. Conn. b. iv. Shuckford, b. viii. Burnet Archæol. Phil. l.

  name="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now, we read that, "in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar,
  Nebuchadnezzar dreamed <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>[45]</span>dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled,
  and his sleep brake from him. Then the king commanded to call the
  magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for
  to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king."<a
  name="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> But when by the king
  required not only to interpret but to reveal the very phantasm itself,
  they declared it beyond the power of their own or human art. Daniel,
  however, of the captive race, revealed it by supernal influence. Then did
  the monarch admit as to Deity, that God (<span class="sc">Jah</span>, Ps.
  lxviii. v. 4) was God of gods (<i>Baalim</i>, the representations of
  Baal).<a name="NtA_46" href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> His second dream
  was again only understood by the inspired representative of the Hebrews.
  But when, finally, appeared the stupendous handwriting on the wall, and
  when Belshazzar and his court were overwhelmed with amazement, so that
  "the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so
  that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against
  another, the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
  and the soothsayers."<a name="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>
  They came; but all in vain. Daniel interpreted the hand-writing at sight,
  and his reading proved true. Some theories prevail about this, which,
  whether correct or not, are entitled to be understood and considered.
  They have, at least, direct reference to our subject of secret
  instruction and writing.</p>

<p><!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>[46]</span></p>

  <p>The wonderful miracles of God at the exodus did not prevent that
  nation from repeated lapse into paganism, and acts of open disobedience
  to the Theocratic law. Still less were they debarred thereby the mere
  oriental customs of imparting moral instruction in secret associations,
  or the pursuit of science in hidden confraternities. But the train of
  thought and instruction in the Hebrew societies was singularly pure, and
  directly at variance with the mysteries of paganism. While the whole
  result of the teaching of the heathen mysteries was to represent,
  symbolically, the fructifying energies of nature (which they supposed to
  be the sum of both science and theology), that of the Israelites was the
  inculcation alone of virtue, the acquisition of science, and the
  preservation of the name of Deity under peculiar forms and ceremonies,
  the recognition of which by members of the initiated, opened from one to
  the other every heart in perfect confidence, constantly reminding them of
  their duty to him as well as to each other. The whole system of oriental
  instruction, save that proclaimed in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, was
  secret. Even the name of Deity could not be pronounced except at low
  breath, or in a whisper, under prescribed forms. Has the reader ever
  asked himself the meaning of the passage in the Lord's Prayer,
  "<i>Hallowed be thy name</i>?" The Hebrews had a visible manifestation of
  God. That was not the only object of reverence. It was limited <!-- Page
  47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>[47]</span>not to any
  manifestation, but to the <i>name</i> of Deity. And that teaching has
  received the express recognition of our Saviour, by his making it a part
  of the selections from the Jewish euchologies which form his prayers. We
  profess to worship Deity in spirit and in truth. Do we hallow his
  <i>name</i>? Mere abstinence from profanation is a negative duty. How
  must it be hallowed? That is a positive duty. Christianity, rejecting the
  Hebrew form, regards this as a mere Hebraism, substituting the name for
  the being himself. The Israelites do not: and one secret society still
  existing, whose origin we shall trace in this essay, still preserves the
  Hebraistic sanctification of the original holy name as their form of
  recognition of each other, under solemnities which hallow it.</p>

  <p>We know that Moses<a name="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
  "was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words
  and deeds." At his day pagan hieratic and hieroglyphic symbols only were
  written on papyrus, or carved and engraved on stone.</p>

  <p>Take, then, the fact, that the Hebrew patriarchs and their tribes of
  his time were suffering under the persecution of hard task-masters in
  Egypt. How could their patriarchs teach to their classes the lessons of
  virtue and morality? We can readily suppose at the conclusion of a
  toilsome day, when all is dark, and tired nature would otherwise be at
  rest, he that had patriarchal authority, at dead of night, when <!-- Page
  48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>[48]</span>their pagan
  rulers could not hear, and while due guard was kept, whether on high
  hills, or in low vales, would summon together those who were worthy <span
  class="scac">TO RECEIVE</span> instruction in moral science, virtue, and
  their patriarchal traditions, and there&mdash;taking as emblems their
  instruments of daily toil&mdash;preserve the lessons which thus alone
  could be imparted. This we believe to be the origin of the <span
  class="sc">Cabbalists</span>, or <i>Kabbalistæ</i>, a secret society
  among the Hebrews, whose origin is lost in antiquity, yet whose knowledge
  may, under God's blessing, have been an instrument in accomplishing his
  great results. Their very name is derived from the Hebrew word <span
  lang="he" title="QBL" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E7;&#x5D1;&#x5DC;</bdo></span>
  (Cabbala, "to receive"). This society of Cabbalistæ, had various methods
  of secret writing. Their first was the scriptura c&oelig;lestis; the
  second, that of angels, or kingly or dominant power; the third, that of
  the passage of the flood (<i>Scriptura transitus fluvii</i>).
  Breithaupt<a name="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> says: "It is
  to be recollected, that the more ancient of the Kabbalistæ, studied out
  even a secret method of writing, consisting of four lines intersecting
  each other at right angles, forming a square in the middle, <!-- Page 49
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>[49]</span>after the
  following method. The figure of the four lines is thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/cabal.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cabal.png"
      alt="Figure of the four lines." title="Figure of the four lines." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>In each section three letters they place from right to left. When,
  therefore, they intend the first of the three, they write the figure of
  that section in which it is found, with one point (<img
  src="images/cab1.png" style="height:1.5ex" alt="L with one dot" />). If
  another (or the next), the same figure with two points (<img
  src="images/cab2.png" style="height:1.5ex" alt="L with two dots" />). if
  the third, the same again with three points (<img src="images/cab3.png"
  style="height:1.5ex" alt="L with three dots" />). and so on. But the
  Cabbalistæ had also a simpler writing: "The sublime philosophy of those
  who are called the Kabbala, embraces within itself different kinds to
  which the following appertain. In their most famous magic pamphlet
  <i>Rasiel</i>, which the Kabbalistæ hold in great respect, in the first
  place three secret alphabets are read, which, in many things, are wanting
  in the common form and syntax of usual Hebrew. The first is called
  <i>Scriptura c&oelig;lestis</i> (the writing of heaven); the next, <span
  lang="he" title="ML'KYM" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5DC;&#x5D0;&#x5DB;&#x5D9;&#x5DD;</bdo></span> or
  <span lang="he" title="MLKYM" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DE;&#x5DC;&#x5DB;&#x5D9;&#x5DD;</bdo></span>, that is, of
  angels or kings (<i>angelorum sive regum</i>); and the third the writing
  of the crossing of the flood."<a name="NtA_50"
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> There <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[50]</span>are extant also, drawings
  of these letters preserved by Hern. Corn. Agrippa, in his work "<i>De
  Occult. Phil.</i> lib. iii. c. 30," the copying of which would be merely
  matter of curiosity to no end.</p>

  <p>But Breithaupt goes much further, and refers to a book, "In
  &OElig;nigmatibus Judæorum Religiosissimis. Helmst. 1708, editio, p. 49,"
  wherein he says,<a name="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> that
  Herm. Vonder Hardt, the most celebrated philologist of our age, remembers
  two singular alphabets used by the Jews in preparing their amulets. The
  first is <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page51"></a>[51]</span>when the next succeeding is substituted for
  the preceding letter in every instance, as to wit: <span lang="he"
  title="B" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D1;</bdo></span> for <bdo dir="ltr"><span
  lang="he" title="'" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;</bdo></span>, <span lang="he"
  title="G" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D2;</bdo></span></bdo> for <span lang="he"
  title="B" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D1;</bdo></span>, and so forth. They are
  said to have concealed in this manner their recognition of the one true
  God, which they recite daily, early and toward evening, and as to which
  they persuade themselves that it is the most efficacious safeguard
  against idolatry, fortified wherewith they can not lapse from true to
  false religion. The other secret alphabet consisted in this, that in
  inversed order they change the last letter <span lang="he" title="T"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5EA;</bdo></span> with the first <span lang="he"
  title="'" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;</bdo></span>, and this and another in
  turn, and so on through the rest, which inversion it is the custom to
  call <span lang="he" title="'TBSH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5EA;&#x5D1;&#x5E9;</bdo></span>. From this they
  produce, by such letters, in their more elaborate amulets, the noted
  symbol <span lang="he" title="MTSPTS" ><bdo

  else than the name of God, <span lang="he" title="YHWH" ><bdo

  <p>If the society of Kabbalistæ originated among the Israelites as early
  as the time of Moses, their secret writings must having been only known
  to him and few besides, with their successors. Solomon, to whom Almighty
  God declared "wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee,"<a name="NtA_55"
  href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> must have learned them; or, if it
  originated with him, Daniel and Ezra, who lived in a succeeding age;
  after the great temple had been destroyed, during the captivity, and at
  the rebuilding of the second temple, both inspired servants of God,
  equally knew them; and when the inscriptions on the wall, or on the ark,
  or in the sacred rolls, were lost and unknown to the people, they were
  easily deciphered by means of the knowledge of the Kabbalistic character,
  no matter what its form. Thus when Daniel saw the handwriting on <!--
  Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>[53]</span>the wall
  he read it at once, possessed as he may have been of the knowledge how to
  read that cipher, while it can readily be seen why the Magi of Chaldea,
  and of Media and Persia, were at fault. It was a secret writing of the
  Hebrews, known only to the select few. Ezra, in the reign of Artaxerxes,
  king of Persia, "was chief-priest. This Ezra went up from Babylon, and he
  was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had
  given."<a name="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> This was, then,
  no new matter to him. The book of the law had been lost during the
  captivity. Yet, at the rebuilding of the temple, Ezra was a ready scribe
  in that lost writing. As such he went up from Babylon to Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>The wisdom of God granted to Solomon, must have provided against the
  foreseen loss of the sacred rolls, and determined a way for their
  discovery, and the manner of reading them. The lost rolls were brought
  forth by Ezra, and were read, notwithstanding the ignorance of their
  ancient language. In what way, so consistent with reason, as by his
  understanding the secret writing known only to the learned of that
  race&mdash;the hidden scripture and instruction of a mysterious society,
  whose only teaching was pure, in accordance with the divine commands of
  the theocracy, and with the oriental manner of instruction in matters of
  science and morality? Did this not furnish him a key to the original
  text? The words of <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>[54]</span>the one must have been recognised by their
  original use in application to the reading of the other; and though the
  language may have changed, the old cipher must have interpreted all. We
  learn that, "after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the
  holiest of all, which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant
  overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had
  manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant," were
  entered.<a name="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The book (or rolls) of the law was commanded to be put within the
  ark.<a name="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> The end of laying
  it there was, that it, as the original, might be reserved there as the
  authentic copy, by which all others were to be corrected and set right.<a
  name="NtA_59" href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> Prideaux contends that,
  the ark deposited in the second temple was only a representative of a
  former ark on the great day of expiation, and to be a repository of the
  Holy Scriptures, that is, of the original copy of that collection which
  was made of them after the captivity, by Ezra and the men of the great
  synagogue; for when this copy was perfected, it was then laid up in it.
  And in imitation hereof, the Jews, in all their synagogues, have a like
  ark or coffer,<a name="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> of the
  same size or form, in which they keep the Scriptures belonging to the
  <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>[55]</span>Synagogue; and whence they take it out with
  great solemnity, whenever they use it, and return it with the like when
  they have done with it. What became of the old ark, on the destruction of
  the temple by Nebuchadnezzar, is a dispute among the Rabbins. The
  Jews&mdash;and herein they are supported by the traditions of the most
  ancient secret society on earth&mdash;contend that it was hid and
  preserved, by Jeremiah, say some, out of the second book of Maccabees.<a
  name="NtA_61" href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> But most of them will
  have it, that King Josiah, being foretold by Huldah, the prophetess, that
  the temple would speedily, after his death, be destroyed, caused the ark
  to be put in a vault under ground, which Solomon, foreseeing this
  destruction, had caused of purpose to be built for the preserving of it.
  And, for the proof hereof, they produce the text where Josiah commands
  the Levites<a name="NtA_62" href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> to put the
  holy ark in the house, "which Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel,
  did build."<a name="NtA_63" href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> Whether
  within or without the ark, or within a secret vault or not, <span
  class="sc">Ezra</span>, the scribe, brought forth the lost book or rolls
  of the law, and established the rules for its future perpetuity, whether
  by writing, or in oral explanation. And here, again, we note the use of
  secrecy in matters of power. From him is derived the present method of
  reading Hebrew, by what is usually known as the <!-- Page 56 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>[56]</span>vowel points in the
  Masoretic text. The Masorites were a set of men whose profession it was
  to write out copies of the Hebrew Scriptures. And the present vowel
  points were used by them, as derived from the secret writings of the
  Cabbalists. The Jews believe that, when God gave to Moses the law in
  Mount Sinai, he taught him first the true readings of it; and, secondly,
  the true interpretation of it; and that both these were handed down, from
  generation to generation, by oral tradition only, till at length the
  readings were written by the accents and vowels, in like manner as the
  interpretations were, by the Mishna and Gemara. The former they call
  Masorah, which signifieth "tradition." The other is called Cabbala, which
  signifieth "reception;" but both of them denote the same thing, that is,
  a knowledge down from generation to generation, in the doing of which,
  there being tradition on the one hand, and reception on the other, that
  which relates to the readings of the Hebrew Scriptures hath its name from
  the former, and that which relates to the interpretations of them from
  the latter. As those who studied and taught the Cabbala were called the
  Cabbalists, so those who studied and taught the Masorah were called the
  Masorites. As the whole business of the Cabbalists and Masorites was the
  study of the true reading of the Hebrew Scriptures, to preserve and teach
  the proper text, they certainly are justly held the most likely to have
  invented, or at least <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>[57]</span>received and preserved these vowel points,
  because the whole use of these points is to serve to this purpose.<a
  name="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

  <p>About this time, in the reign of Darius, otherwise Artaxerxes, who
  sent Ezra and Nehemiah to Jerusalem to restore the state of the Jews,
  first appeared in Persia the famous prophet of the Magi, whom the
  Persians call Zerdusht, or Zaratush, and the Greeks Zoroastres: born of
  mean and obscure parentage, with all the craft and enterprising boldness
  of Mohammed, but much more knowledge. He was excellently skilled in all
  the learning of the East that was in his time; whereas the other could
  neither read nor write. He was thoroughly versed in the Jewish religion,
  and in all the sacred writings of the Old Testament that were then
  extant, which makes it most likely that he was, in his origin, a Jew. It
  is generally said of him, that he had been a servant to one of the
  prophets of Israel, and that it was by this means that he came to be so
  well skilled in the Holy Scriptures, and all other Jewish knowledge. From
  the collation of authorities made by Dr. Prideaux,<a name="NtA_65"
  href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> it would seem that it was Daniel under
  whom he served; besides whom there was not any other master in those
  times, under whom he could acquire all that knowledge, both in things
  sacred and profane, which he was so well furnished with. He founded no
  new <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>[58]</span>religion, but only reformed the old one. He
  found that the eminent of the Magi usurped the sovereignty after the
  death of Cambyses. But they were destroyed, and by the slaughter which
  was then made of all the chief men among them, it sunk so low, that it
  became almost extinct, and Sabianism everywhere prevailed against it,
  Darius and most of his followers on that occasion going over to it. But
  the affection which the people had for the religion of their forefathers,
  and which they had all been brought up in, not being easily to be rooted
  out, Zoroastres saw that the revival of this was the best game of
  imposture that he could then play; and having so good an old stock to
  engraft upon, he with greater ease made his new scions grow. He first
  made his appearance in Media, now called Aderbijan, in the city of Xix,
  say some; in that of Ecbatana, now Tauris, say others. The chief
  reformation which he made in the Magian religion was in the first
  principles of it: for whereas before they had held the being of <span
  class="scac">TWO FIRST CAUSES</span>, the first light, or the good God,
  who was the author of all good; and the other darkness, or the evil god,
  who was the author of all evil; and that of the mixture of these two, as
  they were in a continual struggle with each other, all things were made;
  he introduced a principle superior to them both, <span class="sc">one
  Supreme God</span>, who created both light and darkness, and out of these
  two, according to the alone pleasure of his own will, made all things
  else that are, according to what is <!-- Page 59 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>[59]</span>said:<a name="NtA_66"
  href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> "I am the Lord, and there is none else,
  there is no God besides me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:
  that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that
  there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is none else. I form
  the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord
  do all these things." These words, directed to Cyrus, king of Persia,
  must be understood as spoken in reference to the Persian sect of the
  Magians, who then held light and darkness, or good and evil, to be the
  supreme beings, without acknowledging the great God who is superior to
  both. To avoid making God the author of evil, Zoroaster's doctrine was,
  that God originally and directly created only light or good, and that
  darkness, or evil, followed it by consequence, as the shadow doth the
  person; that light or good had only a real production from God, and the
  other afterward resulted from it as the defect thereof. In sum, his
  doctrine as to this particular was, that there was one Supreme Being,
  independent and self-existent from all eternity. That under him were two
  angels, one the angel of light, who is the author and director of all
  good; and the other the angel of darkness, who is the author and director
  of all evil; and that these two, out of the mixture of light and
  darkness, made all things that are; that they are in a perpetual struggle
  with each other; and that when the angel of light prevails, then the most
  <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>[60]</span>is
  good, and when the angel of darkness prevails, then the most is evil;
  that this struggle shall continue to the end of the world; that then
  there shall be a general resurrection, and a day of judgment, wherein
  just retribution shall be rendered to all according to their works,
  &amp;c. And all this the remainder of that sect, which is <i>now</i> in
  Persia and India do, without any variation, after so many ages still
  hold, even to this day. Another reformation which he made in the Magian
  religion was, that he caused fire temples to be built wherever he came:
  this being to prevent their sacred fires, on the tops of hills, from
  being put out by storms, and that the public offices of their religion
  might be the better performed before the people. Zoroaster pretended he
  was taken up into heaven, there to be instructed in those doctrines which
  he was to deliver unto men. Mohammed pretended to have seen God.
  Zoroaster was too well informed for such imposture. He only claimed to
  have heard him speaking to him out of the midst of a great and most
  bright flame of fire; and he, therefore, taught his followers that fire
  was the truest <i>shechinah</i> of the divine presence. His followers
  thereafter worshipped the sun as the most perfect fire of God. But this
  was an original usage of the Magi (referred to in Ezekiel viii. 16),
  where it is related, that the prophet being carried in a vision to
  Jerusalem, had there shown him "about five-and-twenty men standing
  between the porch and the altar, with <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[61]</span>their backs toward the
  temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped
  the sun." The meaning of which is, that they had turned their backs upon
  the true worship of God, and had gone over to that of the Magians.<a
  name="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> The <i>Kebla</i>, or
  point of the heavens toward which they directed their worship being
  toward the rising sun, that of the Jews in Jerusalem to the Holy of
  Holies on the west end of the temple; of those elsewhere toward
  Jerusalem; of the Mohammedans toward Mecca, and the Sabians toward the
  meridian.</p>

  <p>Come whence it may, what is the meaning of the use of fire in any
  divine worship?</p>

  <p>1. Burnt-offerings of old required it.</p>

  <p>2. It descended on the altars of Elijah, and of Solomon, from God
  himself.</p>

  <p>3. The Magi, from the time of Zoroaster, have deemed it the symbol of
  purity.</p>

  <p>4. The pagan mysteries in Egypt, Greece, and Rome, all preserved the
  "sacred fire." Most religions seem to have adopted its use. Why?</p>

  <p>5. The Catholic church has ever preserved its use in burning tapers,
  lamps, and smoking incense.</p>

  <p>In his reformation of the customs and rites of the Magi, Zoroaster, as
  has been hereinbefore said, preserved their three grades of <span
  class="sc">Apprentices, Masters</span>, and <span class="sc">Perfect
  Masters</span>.<a name="NtA_68" href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> The
  first were the inferior clergy, who served in all the common offices of
  their <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>[62]</span>divine worship; next above them were the
  superintendents, who in their several districts governed the inferior
  clergy, as bishops do with us; and above all was the perfect-master, the
  archimagus, who was the head of the whole religion. Accordingly their
  places of worship were of three sorts. The lowest sort were parochial
  oratories served by the inferior clergy, where they read the daily
  offices out of their liturgy, and on solemn occasions read part of their
  sacred writings to the people. In these churches there were no fire
  altars; but the small scintilla of sacred fire preserved in them, was
  kept only in a lamp. Next above these were their fire temples, in which
  fire was continually burning on a sacred altar. The highest church of all
  was "<i>the fire-temple</i>," the residence of the archimagus, first
  established by Zoroaster at Balch, but removed in the seventh century to
  Kerman, a province in Persia on the southern ocean. To gain the better
  reputation to his pretensions, Zoroaster first retired to a cave, and
  there lived a long time as a recluse, pretending to be abstracted from
  all earthly considerations, and to be given wholly to prayer and divine
  meditations; and the more to amuse the people who there resorted to him,
  he dressed up his cave with several mystical figures, representing
  Mithra, and other mysteries of their religion. In this cave he wrote his
  book, called Zendavesta, or Zend, meaning "fire-kindler," or
  "tinder-box." This book contains much borrowed <!-- Page 63 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>[63]</span>from the Old Testament.
  He even called it the book of Abraham, and his religion the religion of
  Abraham; for he pretended that the reformation which he introduced was no
  more than to bring back the religion of the Persians to that original
  purity in which Abraham practised it, by purging it of all those defects,
  abuses, and innovations, which the corruptions of after-times had
  introduced into it.<a name="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Is it not singular that all the nations of the earth still trace their
  teaching in pure religion to Abraham, whether under the name of Brahma,
  or otherwise?</p>

  <p>These ancient Magi were great mathematicians, philosophers, and
  divines of the ages in which they lived, and had no other knowledge but
  what by their own study, and the instructions of the ancients of their
  sect they had improved themselves in. All of the Magi were not thus
  learned, only those of the higher order. The priesthood, like the Jewish,
  was communicated only from father to son, except to the royal family,<a
  name="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> whom they were bound to
  instruct, the better to fit them for government. Whether it were that
  these Magians thought it would bring the greater credit to them, or the
  kings, that it would add a greater sacredness to their persons, or from
  both these causes, the royal family of Persia, so long as the Magi
  prevailed among them, was always reckoned <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>[64]</span>of the sacerdotal
  tribe.<a name="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> The kings of
  Persia were looked on to be of that sacerdotal order, and were always
  initiated into the sacred rites of the Magians, before they took on them
  the crown, or were inaugurated into the kingdom.<a name="NtA_72"
  href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Pythagoras</span> next assumed, in the west, the most
  prominent place for learning. He was the scholar of Zoroaster at Babylon,
  and learned of him most of that knowledge which afterward rendered him so
  famous. So saith Apulcius (Floridorum secundo), and so say Jamblichus (in
  vita Pythag. c. 4), Porphyry (Ibid. p. 185. edit. Cant.), and Clemens
  Alexandrinus (Stromata i. p. 223) for the Zabratus or Zaratus of
  Porphyry, and the Na-Zaratus of Clemens, were none other than this
  Zoroaster; and they relate the matter thus: that when Cambyses conquered
  Egypt he found Pythagoras there on his travels, for the improvement of
  himself in the learning of that country; that, having taken him prisoner,
  he sent him, with other captives, to Babylon, where Zoroaster (or
  Zabratus, as Porphyry calls him) then lived; and that he there became his
  disciple, and learned many things of him in the eastern learning. There
  may be error as to date, but that Pythagoras was at Babylon, and learned
  there a great part of that knowledge which he was afterward so famous
  for, is agreed by <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>[65]</span>all. His stay there, Jamblichus tells us,
  was twelve years; and that, in his converse with the Magians, he learned
  from them arithmetic, music, the knowledge of divine things, and the
  sacred mysteries pertaining thereto. But the most important doctrine
  which he brought home thence, was that of the immortality of the soul;
  for it was generally agreed among the ancients (Porphysius in vita
  Pythagoræ p. 188, edit., Cant. Jamblichus in vita Pyth. c. 30), that he
  was the first of all the Greeks that taught it. Prideaux says he takes
  this for certain, that Pythagoras had this from Zoroaster, for it was his
  doctrine, and he is the earliest heathen on record who taught it.<a
  name="NtA_73" href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> But Pythagoras seems to
  have combined the notions he then received with those of the Egyptian
  Magi; for he taught immortality to consist in constant transmigration
  from one body to another. The Egyptian Magi claimed to be judges of the
  dead,<a name="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> and taught this
  doctrine. Zoroaster taught a resurrection from the dead, and an immortal
  state as we understand it. And it is probable Pythagoras adopted this
  notion after he fled from Samos to Egypt to escape from the government of
  Polycrates.</p>

  <p>Be this as it may, he was a master-spirit in a secret society with its
  lodges spread through Magna Græcia, originating in one he established at
  Crotona in Lower Italy. Like that of the Cabbalists, this society had no
  connection whatever with the dominant religion. <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[66]</span>The Kabbalistæ taught
  virtue and science, and thus were, perhaps, an auxiliary, but certainly
  no opponent to the sacred teachings of the holy law. The Pythagorean
  league taught philosophy alone; full instruction was given in the liberal
  arts and sciences in accordance with the learning of that age. But, after
  it was thought destroyed (and it was suppressed by Cylon and his faction,
  about the year 500 B.C.), it still exercised a great influence over all
  Greece, in such manner as that Heeren speaks of it as a phenomenon which
  is in many respects without a parallel. The grand object of the moral
  reform of Pythagoras was <span class="scac">SELF-GOVERNMENT</span>. By
  his dignity, moral purity, dress, and eloquence, he excited not only
  attention but enthusiasm. In that day an aristocracy prevailed in Magna
  Græcia, based chiefly on the corrupting tendencies of wealth and luxury.
  Against this class a popular movement commenced, by the influence whereof
  Sybaris was destroyed, and thereupon five hundred nobles fled for safety
  to Crotona, and prayed for protection from that city, which they obtained
  principally by the advice of Pythagoras. (Diod. Sic. xii. p. 77. Wechel.)
  Aristocratic evils he abrogated. A friend of the people, he recognised
  their equal rights: and it would seem that, while he adopted grades in
  knowledge and moral worth, he considered mankind on "a level" so far as
  all political power was concerned. To accomplish this end, he prescribed
  in his own society, and their affiliated <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[67]</span>lodges, or meetings, a
  certain manner of life, distinguished by a most cleanly but not luxurious
  clothing, a regular diet, a methodical division of time, part of which
  was to be appropriated to one's self, and part to the state. Heeren
  remarks, that when a secret society pursues political ends, it naturally
  follows that an opposing party increases in the same degree in which the
  preponderating influence of such a society becomes more felt. In this
  case, the opposition existed already in the popular party. It therefore
  only needed a daring leader, like Cylon, to scatter the society by
  violence; the assembly was surprised, and most of them cut down, while a
  few only, with their master, escaped. They are said, so far as their
  political views were concerned, to have regarded anarchy as the greatest
  evil, because man can not exist without social order. They held that
  everything depended on the relation between the governing and the
  governed; that the former should be not only prudent but mild; and that
  the latter should not only obey, but love their magistrates; that it was
  necessary to grow accustomed, even in boyhood, to regard order and
  harmony as beautiful and useful, disorder and confusion as hateful and
  injurious. They were not blindly attached to a single form of government,
  but insisted that there should be no unlawful tyranny. Where a regal
  government existed, <span class="correction" title="text reads `king'"
  >kings</span> should be subject to the laws, and act only as the chief
  magistrates. They regarded a <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page68"></a>[68]</span>mixed constitution as the best, and where
  the administration rested principally in the hands of the upper class,
  they reserved a share of it for the people. The writings of the
  Pythagoreans commanded high prices, but gained political importance only
  so far as they contributed to the education of distinguished men, of whom
  Epaminondas was one.<a name="NtA_75"
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Another scion of these methods of secret instruction, wherein,
  however, religion was the engine of political power, came from the
  ancient Assyrian stock with Ph&oelig;nician emigration to Great Britain.
  The <span class="sc">Druids</span> controlled the learning of that
  country in religion as in science; and by their mysteries exerted an
  overwhelming influence upon the rulers and the masses.</p>

  <p>Dr. Parsons<a name="NtA_76" href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> says,
  what were the filids, and bards, and the Druids, but professors of the
  sciences among the Gomerians, and Magogians or Scythians, and it is plain
  that, from Phenius downward, there were always, in every established
  kingdom among the Scythians, philosophers and wise men, who, at certain
  times, visited the Greek sages, after they had found their schools? It is
  no easy matter to point out the first rise and ages of the Druids. They
  taught the same opinions of the renovated state of the earth, and of
  souls, with the Magi. According to Cæsar, in his time these Druids
  instructed their youth in the <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page69"></a>[69]</span>nature and motion of the stars, in the
  theory of the earth, its magnitude, and of the world, and in the power of
  the immortal gods. On the continent of Europe, he says, the Druids grew
  into such power and ascendency over the minds of the people, that even
  the kings themselves paid an implicit slavish obedience to their
  dictates; insomuch, that their armies were brave in battle, or abject
  enough to decline even the most advantageous prospects of success,
  according to the arbitrary prognostics of this set of religious tyrants;
  and their decisions became at last peremptory in civil, as well as in the
  affairs of religion. One of the kings of Ireland, the learned <i>Carmac
  o' Quin</i>, great in law and philosophy, who was not afraid to inveigh
  openly against the corruptions and superstition of the Druids, and
  maintained, in his disputations against them, that the original theology
  consisted in the worship of one omnipotent, eternal Being, that created
  all things; that this was the true religion of their ancestors; and that
  the numerous gods of the Druids were only absurdity and
  superstition&mdash;proved fatal to him. For, as this society saw an
  impending danger of their dissolution, they formed a deep conspiracy
  against him, and he was murdered. The Druids on the continent never
  committed their mysteries to writing, but taught their pupils
  <i>memoriter</i>. The Irish and Scotch Druids wrote theirs, but in secret
  character. These were well understood by the learned men who were in
  great numbers, and had <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>[70]</span>not only genius but an ardent inclination to
  make researches into science. St. Patrick, then, with the general consent
  and applause of the learned of that day, committed to the flames almost

  druidical superstition. The Druids preserved the mistletoe evergreen as

  <p>The Thugs, Assassins, Phanzigars, or by what other name they may be
  known, were no society for the development of philosophy or religion;
  and, although they began about this time, are unworthy of farther
  mention. Their mysteries, if any, were only those of the highway robber,
  murderer, or other violater of God's law. Their only secrecy was the
  concealment of their crime.</p>

  <p>But next appeared upon the stage of human life, our Lord and Saviour,
  <span class="sc">Jesus Christ</span>; "The sun of Righteousness, rising
  with healing on his wings:" that <span class="scac">LIGHT</span> of this
  world, which was to draw all men unto him, at the mention of whose name
  "every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and
  things under the earth."<a name="NtA_78"
  href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

  <p>His lessons to man were all oral. The church he established received
  none but traditional instruction. The gospels of his life were written
  more than half a century after the crucifixion. The apostles,
  commissioned to go forth and preach the Gospel, held their meetings in
  upper chambers, and in secrecy, and part of their manner of teaching, if
  not all, was founded upon the still-prevailing systems of the Kabbalistæ
  and philosophers. There were grades observed in the orders of ministry.
  The diaconate, the <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>[72]</span>presbyter, priest or elder, and the <span
  title="episkopos" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;<span class="correction"
  title="text reads `&epsilon;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;'"
  >&pi;</span>&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> or bishop. So there were three
  grades of the laity&mdash;catechumens, (not yet baptized,) baptized
  persons, and "the faithful." The policy of the apostles (who, when they
  were taught to be harmless, were to be wise) adapted itself to the then
  existing state of affairs. It was not only for fear of the Jews, as at
  first, that they adopted the method of instruction in secret, and which
  is to this day recognised by the catholic church as the then
  <i>disciplina arcani</i>, or "discipline of the secret;" but they kept it
  up even during the times of persecution, down to the time of St.
  Augustin. When our Saviour was insulted by the scribes and Pharisees,
  saying, "why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?"
  &amp;c. He said to them, "why do ye also transgress the commandment of
  God by your tradition?"<a name="NtA_79" href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a>
  Still more did he rebuke them, when they asked him, "why walk not thy
  disciples according to the traditions of the elders, but eat bread with
  unwashen hands?" In his answer, he replied, "laying aside the commandment
  of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups,
  &amp;c., &amp;c. And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the
  commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition."<a name="NtA_80"
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> St. Paul afterward, well knowing the
  then systems of philosophy, and their then traditional instruction, wrote
  to them at Philippi,<a name="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>
  "Beware lest any man spoil you through <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>[73]</span>philosophy and vain
  deceit after the tradition of men, after the rudiments (or elements) of
  this world, and not after Christ." Then St. Paul, guarding the early
  Christians so carefully, writes to the faithful in Thessaly, "Now we
  command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye
  withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not
  after the tradition which ye have received <i>of us</i>,"<a name="NtA_82"
  href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> &amp;c. When St. Paul preached on the
  first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread, it
  was in an upper chamber where they were gathered together.<a
  name="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> At an earlier date, the
  first day of the week after the crucifixion, in the evening, "when the
  doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews,
  came Jesus, and stood in the midst," &amp;c.<a name="NtA_84"
  href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> When Pliny was proconsul in Judea, such
  charges were made against the Christians on account of their secrecy, as
  caused severe persecution, not for matters of religion, but for supposed
  cannibalism. He writes to Trajan, that he took all pains to inform
  himself as to the character of the Christian sect. To do this he
  questioned such as had for many years been separated from the Christian
  community, but though apostates rarely speak well of the society to which
  they formerly belonged, he could find out nothing. He then applied
  torture to two female-slaves, deaconesses, to extort from them the truth.
  After all, he could learn only that the <!-- Page 74 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>[74]</span>Christians were in the
  habit of meeting together on a certain day; that they then united in a
  hymn of praise to their God, Christ; and that they bound one
  another&mdash;not to commit crimes, but to refrain from theft, from
  adultery, to be faithful in performing their promises, to withhold from
  none the property intrusted to their keeping; and then separated and
  afterward assembled at a simple and innocent meal.<a name="NtA_85"
  href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Evidently, the Christian mysteries were preserved secret from the
  Romans as from the Jews, or such crime could never have been imputed to
  them. Alluding to the secret traditional instruction prevalent in Judea
  and adopted by the early church, St. Augustin writes, "You have heard the
  great mystery. Ask a man, 'Are you a Christian?' He answers you, 'I am
  not.' 'Perhaps you are a pagan, or a Jew?' But if he has answered 'I am
  not;' then put this question to him, 'Are you a catechumen, or one of the
  faith?' If he shall answer you, 'I am a catechumen;' he is anointed but
  not yet baptized. But, whence anointed? ask him. And he replies. Ask of
  him in whom he believes. From the fact that he is a catechumen, he says,
  in Christ."</p>

  <p>This is the third lecture of St. Augustin on the ninth chapter of St.
  John's gospel, where our Saviour is portrayed as healing the blind man,
  by mixing earth with spittle and anointing his eyes therewith. And St.
  Augustin adds, "Why have I spoken of <!-- Page 75 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>[75]</span>spittle and of mud?
  Because the word is made flesh; this the catechumens hear; but it is not
  sufficient for them as to what they were anointed; let them hasten to the
  font, if they desire light."<a name="NtA_86"
  href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But still further to mark the distinction between these grades of
  Christian secret instruction, St. Augustin, in the eleventh tract on the
  Gospel of St. John, treating of the conversation between Nicodemus and
  our Saviour, as to regeneration, says, "If, therefore, Nicodemus was of
  the multitude who believed in his name, now in that Nicodemus we
  comprehend why Jesus did not trust them. Jesus answered and said to him,
  'Verily, verily I say unto you, unless any one shall have been born
  again, he can not see the kingdom of God.' Jesus placed faith, therefore,
  in those who were born again. Lo! they believed in him, and Jesus did not
  trust in them. Such are all catechumens: they now believe in the name of
  Christ, but Jesus does not confide in them. Let your love comprehend and
  understand this. If we say to a catechumen, 'Do you believe in Christ?'
  He answers, <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page76"></a>[76]</span>'I do,' and signs himself with Christ's
  cross: he bears it on his forehead, and blushes not at his Lord's cross.
  Lo! he believes in his name. Let us ask him, 'Do you eat the flesh of the
  son of man, and drink his blood?' He knows not what we say, because Jesus
  has not trusted him."<a name="NtA_87"
  href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now we are told in Holy Writ in reference to this matter. St. Paul,
  alluding to this secret traditional instruction in the several degrees of
  Christian learning, says to those advanced to a higher or more perfect
  degree: "and I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but
  as unto carnal, even as to babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and
  not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now
  are ye able."<a name="NtA_88" href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> Even
  their first lessons in the great mystery were imperfect. Other and
  further instruction was to complete it. So also St. Peter saith in his
  general letter, "Wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and
  hypocrisies and envies <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page77"></a>[77]</span>and all evil speakings, as new-born babes,
  desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may <i>grow</i> thereby."<a
  name="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> And again, St. Paul
  saith,<a name="NtA_90" href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> "For when for
  the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again
  which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such
  as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. For every one that useth
  milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. But
  strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by
  reason of use" (<i>habit, or perfection</i>) "have their senses exercised
  to discern both good and evil. Therefore leaving the principles" (the
  word of the beginning of Christ) "of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on
  to perfection,"<a name="NtA_91" href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> &amp;c.
  We need not here refer to the wonderful spread of Christianity. We learn
  a plain and simple lesson taught by Jesus, as to the administration of
  his church. "These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying,
  Go not into the way of the Gentiles," &amp;c. "Heal the sick, cleanse the
  lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely have ye received, freely
  give. Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass, in your purses: nor
  scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet a
  staff; for the workman is worthy of his meat."<a name="NtA_92"
  href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> When questioned before Pilate, he
  declared, "My kingdom is not of this world."<a name="NtA_93"
  href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> Whether the successors of the <!-- Page
  78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>[78]</span>apostles have
  or not, since that day, established a kingdom of this world, is not for
  us here to discuss. Whether those that claim such succession obey the
  precept quoted, or not, we do not interfere with.</p>

  <p>To insure unity in the church throughout the world, prudence would
  suggest that there should be some place, free from the control of worldly
  politics, whence its teachings should issue, and its counsels be heard.
  In its infancy the Christian church suffered bitterly from persecution.
  The faithful everywhere received a crown of martyrdom. When earthly
  terrors interposed, the blood of the martyrs proved the seed of the
  church.</p>

  <p>It is for us, however, to trace in history the secret teachings of
  those who have claimed its highest authority in any denomination, and if
  we do not reach their private counsels, their acts proclaim them.</p>

  <p>Has, or not, each Christian church been tempted by worldly power,
  wealth, and honor, like all other systems of religion?</p>

  <p>Have there existed within their jurisdiction, confraternities, with
  secular power, directly or indirectly under their control, seeking by
  secret measures to manage the government of the nations of this
  earth?</p>

  <p>That great Creator, whose word is truth which can not change, declared
  as law to govern all his creatures, "<span class="sc">Thou shalt not
  kill</span>." What saith history of those who claim to have acted in his
  name? Why, and in what manner did they act? <!-- Page 79 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>[79]</span></p>

  <p>The south of France in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries became a
  scene of blood, the immediate cause of which was the erections of the
  "tribunals of faith," better known to us as a secret society called
  "<span class="sc">The Inquisition</span>." Innocent III., who ascended
  the papal chair in 1198, conceived the project thereof, to extirpate the
  rebellious members of the church&mdash;the Albigenses&mdash;and to extend
  the papal power at the expense of the bishops: and his successors carried
  out his plan. This tribunal, "<i>the holy office</i>" or "inquisition"
  (sanctum officium), was under the immediate direction of the papal chair:
  it was to seek out heretics and adherents of false doctrines, and to
  pronounce its dreadful sentence against their fortune, their honor, and
  <i>their lives</i>, without appeal. The process of this tribunal differed
  entirely from that of the civil courts. The informer was not only
  concealed, but rewarded by the inquisition. The accused was obliged to be
  his own accuser. Suspected persons were secretly seized and thrown into
  prison. No better instruments could be found for inquisitors than the
  mendicant orders of monks, particularly the Franciscans and Dominicans,
  whom the pope employed to destroy the heretics, and inquire into the
  conduct of bishops. Pope Gregory IX., in 1233, completed the design of
  his predecessors, and, as they had succeeded in giving these
  inquisitorial monks, who were wholly dependent on the pope, an unlimited
  power, and in rendering the interference <!-- Page 80 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>[80]</span>of the temporal
  magistrates only nominal, the inquisition was successively introduced
  into several parts of Italy, and into some provinces of France; its power
  in the latter country being more limited than in the former. The
  tribunals of faith were admitted into Spain in the middle of the
  thirteenth century, but a firm opposition was made to them, particularly
  in Castile and Leon, and the bishops there maintained their exclusive
  jurisdiction in spiritual matters. For a time this power waned, when,
  afterward in the fifteenth century, it assumed an aspect truly alarming.
  Three religions then prevailed in Spain: Christians, Jews, and
  Mahommedans. The power of the nobles was a bar, at the same time, to the
  absolute power of Ferdinand and Isabella. But this engine of religious
  tyranny accomplished their ends, and became the most powerful instrument
  of their policy. Owing to the fanatical preaching of Fernando Nuñez, who
  taught the persecution of the Jews to be a good work, popular tumults
  prevailed, in which this people was plundered, robbed, and murdered.
  Cardinal Mendoza, at Seville, in 1477, condemned and punished many who
  persevered in opposition to the doctrines of his faith.</p>

  <p>Mendoza recommended the establishment of the inquisition to Ferdinand
  and Isabella. Dependent entirely upon the court, what better engine could
  they use to render their power absolute, by confiscation of estates to
  fill their treasury, and to limit the <!-- Page 81 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>[81]</span>power of the nobles and
  superior clergy? In the assembly of the estates, therefore, held at
  Toledo, 1480, in spite of all opposition, it was determined to establish
  a tribunal, under the name of the general inquisition (<i>general
  inquisicion suprema</i>). This was opened in Seville, 1481. Thomas de
  Torquenada, prior of the Dominican convent at Segovia, father-confessor
  to Mendoza, had been appointed first grand inquisitor by the king and
  queen, in 1478. The peaceful teachings of the meek and lowly Jesus do not
  seem to have had much influence on this political Boanerges. He had two
  hundred familiars, and a guard of fifty horsemen, but he lived in
  continual fear of poison. The Dominican monastery at Seville soon became
  insufficient to contain the numerous prisoners, and the king removed the
  court to the castle in the suburb of Triana. At the first <i>auto da
  fè</i> (act of faith), seven apostate Christians were burnt, and the
  number of penitents was much greater. Spanish writers relate that above
  seventeen thousand were given up to the inquisition. More than two
  thousand were condemned to the flames the first year, and great numbers
  fled to neighboring countries. The then pope, Sixtus IV., opposed the
  establishment of this court, as being the conversion of an ecclesiastical
  into a secular tribunal: but he was compelled to submit to circumstances,
  and actually promulgated a bull subjecting Aragon, Valencia, and Sicily,
  the hereditary dominions of Ferdinand, to the <!-- Page 82 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>[82]</span>inquisitor-general of
  Castile. The introduction of the new tribunal was attended with risings
  and oppositions in many places, excited by the cruelty of the
  inquisitors, and encouraged, perhaps, by the jealousy of the bishops.
  Saragossa and other places refused admission to the inquisitors, many of
  whom lost their lives; but the people were obliged to yield in the
  contest; and <i>the kings not only became the absolute judges in matters
  of faith, but the honor, property, and life of every subject were in
  their hands</i>. The political importance of this institution may be
  estimated by the following statement. In every community, the grand
  inquisitor must fix a period, from thirty to forty days, within which
  time heretics, and those who have lapsed from the faith, shall deliver
  themselves up to the inquisition. Penitent heretics and apostates,
  although pardoned, could hold no public office, nor become lessees,
  lawyers, physicians, apothecaries, or grocers; nor wear gold, silver, or
  precious stones; nor ride; nor carry arms; during their whole life, under
  a penalty of being declared guilty of a relapse into heresy: and they
  were obliged to give up a part of their property for the support of the
  war against the Moors. Those who did not surrender themselves within the
  time fixed were deprived of their property irrevocably. The absent, also,
  and those who had been long dead, could be condemned, provided there was
  sufficient evidence against them. The bones of those who were condemned
  after death were dug up, <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>[83]</span>and the property which they had left
  escheated to the king.</p>

  <p>At first the jurisdiction of the inquisition was not accurately
  defined; but it was regularly organized by the ordinance of 1484,
  establishing branches in the different provinces of Spain, under the
  direction of the inquisitor-general. The inquisitor-general presided,
  with aid of six or seven counsellers nominated by the king; and his
  officers were a fiscal (or quasi prosecuting attorney), two secretaries,
  a receiver, two relators, a secuestrador (or escheator), and officials.
  In an ordinance of 1732, it was made the duty of all believers, to inform
  the inquisition, if they knew any one, living or dead, present or absent,
  who had wandered from the faith, who did observe, or had observed the
  laws of Moses, or even spoken favorably of them: if they knew any one who
  followed, or had followed the doctrines of Luther; any one who had
  concluded an alliance with the devil, either expressly or virtually; any
  one who possessed any heretical book, or the Koran, or the Bible in the
  Spanish tongue; or, in fine, if they knew any one who had harbored,
  received, or favored heretics. If the accused did not appear at the third
  summons he was excommunicated. From the moment that the prisoner was in
  the power of the court he was cut off from the world. Then followed
  tortures, solitary confinement, and death in flames, with every attendant
  of abject humiliation, while his name, with that <!-- Page 84 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>[84]</span>of his children and
  grand-children, was officially declared infamous. Napoleon crushed this
  monstrous iniquity December 4, 1808. According to the estimate of
  Llorente, the number of victims of the Spanish inquisition, from 1481 to
  1808, amounted to 341,021 persons.</p>

  <p>In Portugal the inquisition was established in 1557. Whence they also
  carried a branch of it to Goa, in the East Indies; in like manner as the
  Spaniards established one in America.<a name="NtA_94"
  href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

  <p>From the earlier days, however, of the Christian religion we find a
  select few known as the <span class="scac">MYSTICS</span>, steadily
  pursuing a peaceful course in the investigation of truth. Of them it is
  said, that they exercised a powerful influence both upon life and
  literature: and, although the inculcation of meekness and
  self-humiliation paralyzed active exertion, and a life devoted to
  emotions and sentiments occasionally produced fanaticism, yet this
  influence, especially in the middle ages was highly beneficial. John
  Tauler, of Strasbourg, Henry Suss, of Constance, and Thomas à Kempis,
  were active mystics, and eminent among their fraternity which was called
  "the brethren of the common life." Theirs was a religion of feeling,
  poetry, and imagination, in contrast with philosophical rules and forms
  of reasoning, as taught by the school-men. They excused their fanaticism,
  by appealing to the words of St. Paul: <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>[85]</span>"The spirit prays in us
  by sighs and groans that are unutterable." Now, if the spirit, say they,
  prays in us, we must resign ourselves to its motions, and be swayed and
  guided by its impulse, by remaining in mere inaction. Hence, passive
  contemplation they considered the highest state of perfection. The number
  of the mystics increased in the fourth century under the influence of the
  Grecian fanatic, who gave himself out as Dionysius, the Areopagite, a
  disciple of St. Paul, and probably lived about this period; and by
  pretending to higher degrees of perfection than other Christians, and
  practising greater austerities, their cause gained ground, especially in
  the eastern provinces in the fifth century. A copy of the pretended works
  of Dionysius, was sent by Balbus to Louis the Meek, in the year 824,
  which kindled the flame of mysticism in the western provinces, and filled
  the Latins with the most enthusiastic admiration of this new religion. In
  the twelfth century these mystics took the lead in their method of
  expounding Scripture; and by searching for mysteries and hidden meanings
  in the plainest expressions, forced the word of God into a conformity
  with their visionary doctrines, their enthusiastic feelings, and the
  system of discipline which they had drawn from the excursion of their
  irregular fancies. In the thirteenth century they were the most
  formidable antagonists of the schoolmen, and toward the close of the
  fourteenth many of them resided and propagated their tenets in <!-- Page
  86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>[86]</span>almost every
  part of Europe. In the fifteenth century they had many persons of
  distinguished merit in their number; and in the sixteenth, previously to
  the Reformation, it is said that the only true sparks of real piety were
  to be found among them.<a name="NtA_95"
  href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Let us, then, examine the rise of confraternities attached to, and of,
  the Christian church, yet not necessarily more than its other laity
  entitled to authority which they afterward usurped.</p>

  <p>Monachism took its rise in the East, where a solitary and
  contemplative life, devoted to the consideration of divine subjects, had
  always been considered more meritorious than active exertion. This
  calling was gradually adopted by so many, that at the end of the third
  century, the Egyptian Antonius, who had cast away his vast possessions,
  and chosen the desert for his residence, collected together the hitherto
  dispersed anchorites (monachi) into fenced places (monasteria, cænobia,
  claustra, cloisters), that they might live together in fellowship; and
  his disciple, Pachomius, soon gave the brotherhood a rule. Monachism soon
  extended to the west. In the sixth century, Benedict, of Nursia,
  established the first monastery on Mount Casius, in Lower Italy, and
  became, by this means, the founder of the widely-spread order of
  Benedictines, which rapidly extended itself among all nations, and built
  many convents. These monasteries, erected, for the most part, in <!--
  Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page87"></a>[87]</span>beautiful and remote situations, and the
  inhabitants of which were obliged to take the three vows of chastity
  (celibacy), personal poverty, and obedience, proved in those days of
  lawlessness and barbarism, a blessing to mankind. They converted heaths
  and forests into flourishing farms. They afforded a place of refuge
  (asylum) to the persecuted and oppressed. They ennobled the rude minds of
  men by the preaching of the Gospel. They planted the seeds of morality
  and civilization in the bosoms of the young by their schools for
  education. And they preserved the remains of ancient literature and
  philosophy from utter destruction. Many of the Benedictine monasteries
  were the nurseries of education, the arts, and the sciences, as St.
  Gallen, Fulda, Reichenau, and Corvey (in Westphalia), and many others.
  When the Benedictine order became relaxed, the monastery in Clugny, in
  Burgundy, separated itself from them in the tenth century, and introduced
  a more rigid discipline. In the twelfth century the monks of Clugny
  numbered upward of two thousand cloisters. But this order, also, soon
  proved insufficient to satisfy the strong demands of the middle age,
  against the allurements of sin, and the seductions of the flesh; so that,
  at the end of the eleventh century, the Cistercians, and, a few decades
  later, the Premonstrants sprang up: the former in Burgundy (Citeaux), the
  latter in a woody country near Laon (Premontré). The order of
  Carthusians, founded about the year <!-- Page 88 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>[88]</span>1084, which commenced
  with a cloister of anchorites (Carthusia, Chartreuse) in a rugged valley
  near Grenoble, was the most austere in its practice. A life of solitude
  and silence in a cell, a spare and meagre diet, a penitential garment of
  hair, flagellations, and the rigid practices of devotional exercises,
  were duties imposed upon every member of this fraternity.</p>

  <p>They deserve, at our hands, the full benefit of an honest and severe
  Christian effort to find out and nurture truth; so long as government and
  political power did not control them. History next tells us of the
  so-called "<span class="scac">MENDICANT ORDERS</span>." They originated
  in the thirteenth century, and this establishment was productive of
  remarkable results. Francis of Assisi (<span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1226), the son of a rich merchant, renounced all his possessions, clothed
  himself in rags, and wandered through the world, begging, and preaching
  repentance. His fiery zeal procured him disciples, who, like himself,
  renounced their worldly possessions, fasted, prayed, tore their backs
  with scourges, and supplied their slender wants from voluntary alms and
  donations. The order of Franciscans then spread rapidly through all
  countries. About the same time arose the order of Dominicans, or
  preaching monks, founded by an illustrious and learned Spaniard,
  Dominicus. Their chief objects were the maintenance of the predominant
  faith in its considered purity, and the extinction of heretical opinions.
  In <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page89"></a>[89]</span>carrying these out, they became endowed with
  the greatest worldly and temporal privileges, received the powerful
  patronage of the pope, gradually obtained the chairs in the universities,
  and took the lead in the murder of their fellow creatures through the
  inquisition. What a temptation to brawling mendicants, too lazy to earn a
  living, authorized to beg, and the supple tools of political leaders; and
  all this by a mysterious society, under the guise and pretence of the
  Christian religion! Laic tools for such clerical workmen!</p>

  <p>While, from the mystics of that date, valuable works have been
  preserved, what has been left us from these mendicant orders? Anything
  save the cry of blood from the earth? Aught else than servile obedience
  in accomplishing the mandates of those in power?</p>

  <p>In the eleventh century, the crusades had given rise to a singular
  class of men, half-military, half-monk. They had their secret means of
  recognition, a peculiar garb, and a professed object. Religion was the
  motive cause, while science and philosophy seem to have been secondary
  with them. They were knights, of three orders, viz.: the Knights of St.
  John, or Hospitallers; the Templars; and the Teutonic Knights. The
  Knights of St. John are known equally by the name of the Knights of
  Malta, because, in 1530, Charles V. granted them the islands of Malta,
  Gozzo, and Comino, on condition of perpetual war <!-- Page 90 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>[90]</span>against the infidels and
  pirates, and the restoration of these islands to Naples, if the order
  should succeed in recovering Rhodes. The chief of this order had immense
  possessions in most parts of Europe. Their chief was called <i>Grand
  Master of the Holy Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem</i>, and <i>Guardian
  of the Army of Jesus Christ</i>. He was chosen by vote, and lived at La
  Villette in Malta. Foreign powers addressed him as <i>Altezza
  eminentissima</i>. His income equalled a million of guilders annually.
  This order still exists. Originally the affairs of the order were
  exercised by "<span class="scac">THE CHAPTER</span>," which consisted of
  eight balliages (<i>ballivi conventuali</i>), of the different languages
  of which the knights of the order consisted, that is, Provence, Auvergne,
  France, Italy, Aragon, Germany, Castile, and England. The lands of these
  ballivi conventuali of languages were divided into three classes,
  priories, balliages, and commanderies. Of the priories the German had the
  preference, and was called the Grand Priory.</p>

  <p>This confraternity were free-masons. And their organization was framed
  accordingly. Such was their kindness and benevolence to a wandering and
  unprotected pilgrim, that when afterward accosted on his journey with the
  customary inquiry, "Whence came you?" one and multitudes would answer,
  "From a lodge of the Holy St. John of Jerusalem," having experienced
  their hospitality and kindness in their pilgrimage. Their duty was to
  nurse, accommodate, <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>[91]</span>and protect pilgrims to the Holy Land: and
  everywhere on their travels, in whatever country, these lodges (or
  <i>hutten</i>) were found for their comfort.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of the twelfth century a secret order was formed,
  "for the defence of the Holy Sepulchre, and the protection of Christian
  Pilgrims." They were first called "The poor of the Holy City," and
  afterward assumed the appellation of "Templars," because their house was
  near the Temple. The order was founded by Baldwin II., then king of
  Jerusalem, with the concurrence of the pope.</p>

  <p>Many of the noblest knights connected themselves therewith, and they
  became known, then, as the <span class="sc">Knights Templars</span>.</p>

  <p>But the order degenerated, became faithless to their vows, and used
  the wealth and power they had attained in such manner as to occasion
  their public condemnation.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of the fourteenth century a sect of soi-disant
  philosophers appeared, known as the <span class="sc">Rosicrucians</span>.
  They bound themselves together by a solemn secret, which they all swore
  inviolably to preserve; and obliged themselves, at their admission into
  the order, to a strict observance of certain established rules. They
  pretended chiefly to devote themselves to medicine, but above all that,
  to be masters of important secrets, and among others, that of the
  philosopher's stone; all which they affirmed to have received by
  tradition from the ancient Egyptians, <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>[92]</span>Chaldeans, the Magi, and
  the Gymnosophists. By their pretences that they could restore youth, they
  received the name of <i>Immortelles</i>. Their pretension to all
  knowledge, acquired for them the title of <i>Illuminati</i>. For years
  they were lost sight of. Consequently, when in later years they once more
  appeared under their original organization, they have been recognised as
  "<i>The invisible brothers</i>." Their name is not, as generally
  supposed, derived from <i>rosa</i> and <i>crux</i>: but it is from
  <i>ros</i> (dew), the then supposed solvent of gold, and <i>crux</i> (the
  cross). To see, perhaps, a badge of this order, mark the arms of Luther!
  a cross placed upon a rose. True, a mistake as to the definition, yet
  does it not indicate the reason of its use politically and otherwise?</p>

  <p>Passing by, then, the middle ages, we commence a new era with the rise
  and progress of a religious secret order, without a parallel in the
  history of the world; one which has risen in influence and power far
  above all the other orders of the church, prohibiting its members to
  accept office in the church, yet which, in the art of ruling, has
  excelled the governments of the world hitherto, no less than any of its
  ecclesiastical rivals of any age or country.</p>

  <p>The Society of Jesus&mdash;known as <span class="sc">the
  Jesuits</span>&mdash;early raised itself to a degree of historical
  importance unparalleled in its kind. This order was founded (1539) by
  Ignatius Loyola, who called it the Society of Jesus, in consequence of a
  vision, and bound the <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page93"></a>[93]</span>members, in addition to the usual vows of
  poverty, chastity, and implicit obedience to their superiors, to a
  fourth, viz: to go, unhesitatingly, and without recompense, whithersoever
  they should be sent, as missionaries for the conversion of infidels and
  heretics, or for the service of the church in any other way, and to
  devote all their powers and means to the accomplishment of the work. The
  intention of Ignatius Loyola was originally directed rather to mystic and
  ascetic contemplations; but the order, from the nature of its fourth vow,
  soon took a shape adapted to the wants of the church.</p>

  <p>The origin of this society seems to have been a vision to the
  over-wrought mind of Loyola: may we call it a temporary inflammation of
  the brain? He was a Spaniard of very warm imagination, and a man of great
  sensibility. He declared he saw Mary, the mother of Jesus, in a vision:
  that she gave him the power of chastity: that Jesus and Satan appeared to
  him in the form of military officers enlisting men for service; whereupon
  he followed Christ. The society designated their object by Loyola's
  motto&mdash;<i>Omnia ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>. The intimate union of
  this society has been insured by severe trials, constant inspection, and
  unconditional obedience. Thoroughly organized by past experience, it now
  quietly pursues a policy deep, powerful, and difficult to be met on
  account of its mysticism. After Loyola's death the society was farther
  developed by Lainez, <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page94"></a>[94]</span>and after him, by Aquaviva, men of deep
  knowledge of mankind, and steadfast purpose, who became the real authors
  of the present society. The seat of the society was, in so far, in Rome,
  as the general of the order resided there, with the committee of the
  society, and the monitor, who, totally independent of him, controlled the
  general as if he were his conscience. The order was divided into
  provinces, each of which was superintended by a provincial. Under the
  care of these officers were the professed-houses, with each a præpositus
  at its head, and the colleges, with each a rector. In the latter there
  were also novices. The mutual dependence of all parts of the system
  resemble the structure of a well-built fabric. The relations of
  subordination are so well ordered that the society is <i>simplex duntaxat
  unum</i>, without interrupting the free will of the individual, as is
  said, who only had to obey in permitted things.</p>

  <p>The popes Paul III. and Julius III., seeing what a support they would
  have in the Jesuits against what is usually called "the Reformation,"
  which was rapidly gaining ground, granted to them privileges such as no
  body of men, in church, or state, had ever before obtained. They were
  permitted not only to enjoy all the rights of the mendicant and secular
  orders, and to be <i>exempt from all episcopal and civil jurisdiction</i>
  and taxes, so that they acknowledged no authority but that of the pope
  and the superiors of their order, and were permitted to exercise every
  <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>[95]</span>priestly function, parochial rights
  notwithstanding, among all classes of men, even during an interdict; but,
  also (what is not even permitted to archbishops unconditionally), they
  could absolve from all sins and ecclesiastical penalties, change the
  objects of the vows of the laity, acquire churches and estates without
  further papal sanction, erect houses for the order, and might, according
  to circumstances, dispense themselves from the canonical observance of
  hours of fasts and prohibition of meats, and even from the use of the
  breviary. Besides this, their general was invested with unlimited power
  over the members; could send them on missions of every kind, even among
  excommunicated heretics; could appoint them professors of theology at his
  discretion, wherever he chose, and confer academical dignities, which
  were to be reckoned equal to those given by universities. These
  privileges, which secured to the Jesuits a spiritual power almost equal
  to that of the pope himself, together with a greater impunity, in point
  of religious observance, than the laity possessed, were granted them to
  aid their missionary labors, so that they might accommodate themselves to
  any profession or mode of life, among heretics, and infidels, and be
  able, wherever they found admission, to organize Catholic churches
  without a further authority. A general dispersion, then, of the members
  throughout society with the most entire union and subordination, formed
  the basis of their constitution. <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>[96]</span></p>

  <p>In the education of youth, there has been a very unjust charge against
  them, that is, that they mutilated the classics. Would to God that every
  pure Christian would follow such an example; and that we might thereby
  present such an expurgated edition, as would create all the good they may
  contain, devoid of evil. Any who have read Virgil, Ovid, Terence, or
  other classic works, must acknowledge this necessity. Even Shakespeare's
  plays can not be read, as printed, in a modest company. There is not,
  either, any prudery in this. And, accordingly, a family expurgated
  edition has been published by Dr. Bowdler, demanding a far greater
  circulation than it may have as yet received. Praise, then, be awarded to
  all instructors of youth who will promote such expurgation from the
  classics as will blot out their immorality!</p>

  <p>The latitude in which this society has understood its rights and
  immunities has given occasion to fear an unlimited extension and exercise
  of them, dangerous to all existing authority, civil and ecclesiastical,
  as the constitution of the order, and its erection into an independent
  monarchy in the bosom of other governments, have assumed a more fixed
  character.</p>

  <p>This society seems to have been divided into different ranks or
  classes. The <i>novices</i>, chosen from the most talented and
  well-educated youths, and men without regard to birth or external
  circumstances; and who were tried for two years, in separate <!-- Page 97
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[97]</span>novitiate
  houses, in all imaginable exercises of self-denial and obedience, to
  determine whether they would be useful to the purposes of the order, were
  not ranked among the actual members, the lowest of whom are the
  <i>secular coadjutors</i>, who take no monastic vows, and may, therefore,
  be dismissed. They serve the order partly as subalterns, partly as
  confederates, and may be regarded as the people of the Jesuit state.
  Distinguished laymen, public officers, and other influential personages
  (e.g., Louis XIV., in his old age), were honored with admission into this
  class, to promote the interests of the order. Higher in rank, stand the
  <i>scholars</i> and <i>spiritual coadjutors</i>, who are instructed in
  the higher branches of learning, take upon themselves solemn monastic
  vows, and are bound to devote themselves particularly to the education of
  youth. These, as it were, the artists of the Jesuit community, are
  employed as professors in academies, as preachers in cities, and at
  courts; as rectors, and professors in colleges, as tutors and spiritual
  guides in families which they wish to gain or to watch, and as assistants
  in the missions. Finally, the nobility, or highest class, is made up of
  <i>the professed</i>, among whom are admitted only the most-experienced
  members, whose address, energy, and fidelity to the order, have been
  eminently tried and proved. According to one statement, they make
  profession, that is, take the vows of their order, by binding themselves
  in addition to the common <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>[98]</span>monastic vows by the fourth vow, to the
  undertaking of missions, among whom they consider heathen and heretics,
  as governors in colonies in remote parts of the world, as
  father-confessors of princes, and as residents of the order in places
  where it has no college. They are entirely exempt, on the other hand,
  from the care of the education of youth. None but the professed have a
  voice in the election of a general, who must himself be of their number,
  and who has the right of choosing from them the assistants, provincials,
  superiors, and rectors. The general holds his office for life, and has
  his residence in Rome, where he is attended by a monitor, and five
  assistants or counsellors, who also represent the five chief nations: the
  Italians, Germans, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. He is the centre of
  the government of the whole order, and receives monthly reports from the
  provincials, and one every quarter from the superiors of the
  professed-houses, from the rectors of the colleges, and from the masters
  of the novices. These reports detail all remarkable occurrences,
  political events, and the characters, capacities, and services of
  individual members, and thereupon the general directs what is to be done,
  and how to make use of tried and approved members. All are bound to obey
  him <span class="correction" title="text reads `implicity'"
  >implicitly</span>, and even contrary to their own convictions. There is
  no appeal from his orders.</p>

  <p>Loyola died July 31, 1556, leaving to the order a sketch of this
  constitution, and a mystical treatise <!-- Page 99 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>[99]</span>called "Exercitia
  Spiritualia," which work occupies the first four weeks of every novice.
  The rapid increase of the order, and the previous purity of Loyola's
  life, obtained canonization for him in 1662. Their first great missionary
  was St. Francis Xavier, whose labors (1541) in the Portuguese East
  Indies, where he died ten years afterward, have obtained for him the name
  of "the apostle of India", and the honor of canonization. We are told
  that, at Goa, Travancore, Cochin, Malacca, Ceylon, and Japan, some
  hundred thousand were by him converted to the Christian religion. If so,
  at present the light of it has become very dim. <i>Stat nominis
  umbra.</i> The inquisition at Goa, perhaps, may have shown the people the
  difference between theory and practice. Claudius Aquaviva, of the family
  of the dukes of Atri, general of the Jesuits from 1581 to 1615, is the
  author of their system of education. The want of deep, critical learning,
  with the mutilation of the classics (for which last they deserve praise,
  not blame), exposed their teachers, for a time, to the censure of
  philologists. Viewed with suspicion by the French, they only were
  admitted into that nation in 1562, under the name of "the Fathers of the
  College of Clermont," with a humiliating renunciation of their most
  important privileges, but they soon united in the factions of that
  country, and, notwithstanding a strong suspicion of their having had a
  share in the murder of Henry III., under the <!-- Page 100 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>[100]</span>protection of the
  Guises, they contrived to establish themselves, regain their privileges,
  and deprive the French Protestants of their rights. One of their pupils,
  John Chatel, attempted Henry's life (1594), and this caused their
  banishment until 1603, when, at the intercession of the pope, they were
  again restored by Henry IV. That they participated in the crime of
  Ravaillac could never be proved. They became the confidential advisers in
  Germany, of Ferdinand II. and III. They discovered remarkable political
  talent in the thirty years' war; the league of the Catholics could do
  nothing without them. Father Lamormain, a Jesuit, and confessor to the
  emperor, effected the downfall of Wallenstein, and by means of his
  agents, kept the jealous Bavarians in their alliance with Austria. Then
  burst upon them in France and the Netherlands, the hurricane of the
  Jansenist controversy, when Pascal's Provincial Letters scathed them, and
  his sentiments were even quoted (1679) by Innocent IX., against
  sixty-five of their offensive propositions. Complaints were made against
  some of them by the Iroquois, who had been converted by them, as would
  appear by the treaty of peace (1682). In 1759, by an edict, they were
  declared guilty of high-treason, and expelled from Portugal. Owing to
  difficulties at Martinique under their deputy, Father La Vallette, and
  the declaration of their general, Lorenzo Ricci, refusing to make any
  change in their constitution (<i>sint aut non sint</i>), "let them be as
  they <!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page101"></a>[101]</span>are, or not be," the king of France (1764)
  issued a decree for abolishing the order in all the French states, as
  being a mere political society, dangerous to religion, whose object was
  self-aggrandizement. In 1767 they were driven out of Spain, and soon
  after from Naples, Parma, and Malta. And the voice of public opinion at
  length compelled Pope Clement XIV. to publish his famous bull, <i>Dominus
  ac Redemptor noster</i>, of July 21, 1773, by which the society of Jesus
  was totally abolished in all the states of Christendom. The society,
  however, did not become extinct. In 1780 they were thought to have
  possessed themselves of the secrets of the Rosicrucians, and to have
  taken a part in the schemes of the Illuminati. In 1787, an unsuccessful
  attempt was made to revive the order under the name of the
  <i>Vicentines</i>. Pius VII. restored the order, in 1814, upon the
  issuance of the bull, August 7, <i>Solicitudo omnium</i>. In 1815 they
  were restored in Spain. Russia, by an imperial ukase, March 25, 1820,
  banished them thence. Since then they have been driven from Mexico, again
  restored by Santa Anna, and now, though resident, they are politically
  powerless under the administration of President Comonfort. They now seem
  to rely on the United States of America as their chief asylum, and upon
  the valley of the Mississippi river and its tributaries, as their basis
  of operations. Full and perfect freedom of thought and speech, of
  religious toleration, and of mode of life, monastic or <!-- Page 102
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>[102]</span>otherwise,
  insures to them a safe home in this country. They possess a flourishing
  college at Georgetown, which may almost be considered as part of the city
  of Washington, the capital of the United States. Also one at Cincinnati,
  and one at St. Louis, well endowed, and possessed of great wealth. They
  exercise a powerful yet unseen influence over the minds of the members of
  the Catholic faith where they reside, each naturalized citizen of which
  has an equal voice in selecting all officers of state and general
  government. An eminent writer has remarked, that everything in history
  has its time, and the order of Jesuits can never rise to any great
  eminence in an age in which knowledge is so rapidly spreading. We think
  differently. A society so capable of adaptation to any circumstances,
  whether political, religious, or social, plastic in nature to meet every
  desired impression, talented, highly learned, wealthy, and among others,
  embracing in its order some men of such pure and admirable life as to be
  cited as examples of virtue and Christian character, with the protection
  the American flag throws around all under its folds, is to be carefully
  observed. Human nature is always the same. The past history, then, of
  this society merits the study of every philanthropist and patriot. Once,
  in Paraguay, it became a blessing to mankind. Within due limits, it may
  be so anywhere. But its interference in any political affairs, under
  pretence of serving him, whose "kingdom is not of this <!-- Page 103
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>[103]</span>world," is not
  to be tolerated, as it may prove a most dangerous engine in the struggle
  of the cause of popular self-government. An unconditional surrender of
  one's own convictions to the will of another man is at variance with
  <i>every</i> principle of republicanism.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The Struggle between an alleged <i>Jus Divinum Regum</i>, and Popular
  Sovereignty.&mdash;And the Efforts now attempted to destroy our Grand
  Experiment of Self-Government.&mdash;Practical Results.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With the differences of religious bodies as to dogmas of faith, this
  essay has nothing to do; but so far as churches connected with any
  religion, interfere with temporal governments, by mystic confraternities,
  that is a topic directly within our scope. Any union of church and state
  must, from these authorities, appear in opposition to the unprejudiced
  action of the citizen in the government of his country.</p>

  <p>The great struggle for political power, the contest as to the source
  thereof&mdash;whether a fancied divine right (<i>jus divinum</i>) in any
  family, or in an individual by anointment of a priest; or the free voice
  of a free people governing themselves by framing a constitution, limiting
  power in the hands of rulers, who are only their agents&mdash;is now
  undergoing a severe test. Of this, however, more hereafter.</p>

  <p>The history of England, from the days of James II.&mdash;yes, even
  from Henry VIII., whose crimes form a strange contrast to his assumption
  of a title to being <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>[105]</span>head of a church&mdash;presents a singular
  contest for political power, by means of religious domination.</p>

  <p>From the days of William of Orange, the parties in Ireland (which
  seems to have formed the battleground of these contestants) have been not
  only well-defined, but they have been organized in the most perfect
  mysticism, into Orange men and Ribbon men. Let the days of Curran,
  Grattan, and of the persecuting government tell that story. The blood of
  an Emmett has crowned a noble effort with martyrdom. His last speech will
  be read as long as school-books can perpetuate one of the finest efforts
  of oratory.</p>

  <p>Meantime, a secret society still existed which softened down asperity,
  and extended the blessings of fraternity even among those arrayed against
  each other&mdash;not only there, but over the world. By its teachings and
  its obligations, universal charity was inculcated. Is there an
  intelligent <span class="sc">Free-Mason</span> who has perused our
  previous pages, but what has recognised the history of his own society
  from the origin of the Kabbalistæ? Spread everywhere, under whatever
  name, emanating from a common origin, recognised by common principles and
  instruction, enforcing the study of the liberal arts and sciences,
  teaching philosophy throughout the world, and the hope of a future
  immortality, it has, as a mystic order, taken deep root in every nation,
  but more so in republics, not having fear of an interdict, or other
  religious <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>[106]</span>fulmination. It has not and does not
  interfere in politics, nor seek political power in any shape. Like its
  brothers of old under Pythagoras in Magna Græcia, it teaches philosophy,
  and is well calculated to promote such education as must form true
  statesmen. So catholic is its every teaching, and such are its fraternal
  tendencies, that one church has placed it under ban. Throughout the
  world, whether among the descendants of the ancient Magi, the Hebrew
  Cabbalist, the Rosicrucian, or Templar, in the deserts of Africa, the
  forests of America, or on the wide-spread ocean, the symbols of
  recognition are known and received. Such have been its tendencies that
  spurious imitations for mere political purposes have been frequent. The
  Illuminati, the Carbonari, and other secret political societies have been
  supposed to be Masonic lodges. But it is a great mistake. The Kabbalists
  never interfered with, or acted in opposition to the Hebrew Theocracy.
  Their brothers of a later date have never interfered with politics, even
  to the present day; nor have they, in any wise, inculcated a single maxim
  at variance with their duty to God, their neighbor, or themselves. They
  have simply preserved and obeyed the original traditional instruction
  handed down to them.</p>

  <p>Another benevolent secret society has sprung up, chiefly in the United
  States, calling themselves the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. This is
  a charitable confraternity, intended, mainly, to promote <!-- Page 107
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[107]</span>benevolence,
  aid the sick and distressed, and cultivate the warmer sympathies of our
  nature. It is of modern origin, and in most things seems to be an
  imitation of Free-Masonry. It has been productive of great good in the
  accomplishment of its benevolent purposes. Having no leaning whatever
  toward politics, it quietly pursues its mission of love.</p>

  <p>Thus, then, we have arrived at a point where we must pause.</p>

  <p>The summary of the past seems to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>I. From the earliest history of the world there seems to have been an
  effort on the part of those who pretended to control the consciences and
  religious views of others to preserve in their own hands, the predominant
  <i>political</i> power.</p>

  <p>1. The first government recorded is that of Nimrod. He discarded
  patriarchal instruction; united tribes in cities; and formed their
  combination into an empire. The Magi controlled him, and, at his death,
  under the pretence of his deification, preserved his power in the
  priesthood.</p>

  <p>2. In the extension of the Magi, every great leader, or king, was one
  of them; and obedient to the rules and instructions of their general, the
  Hierophant.</p>

  <p>3. When, in the assertion of popular right, Pythagoras was driven away
  by Cylon, the then imperfect effort of self-government fell through. But
  little understood, its then dim light faded.</p>

  <p>4. The society of the <i>Kabbalistæ</i>, part of whom <!-- Page 108
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>[108]</span>were afterward
  known as the <i>Pythagorean league</i>, as the <i>Collegio fabrorum</i>
  of Numa Pompilius, as the <i>Liberi Architectonici</i> of the middle
  ages, and as the <i>Free-Masons</i> of the present day; this society, I
  repeat, never interfered in politics.</p>

  <p>5. The Christian church was tempted to forget, that Christ's kingdom
  was not of this world. And its two great branches, that of Rome and
  England, were seduced into the error of seeking to obtain power through
  public policy.</p>

  <p>Rome exerted her influences through her prætorian cohorts, the
  confraternities of mendicants and of Jesus&mdash;the Jesuits. Unknown,
  and in silence, they were domiciliated in courts and in families,
  throughout all nations; and some roamed as itinerants. The will of their
  general, on their unconditional subserviency to his behest, seemed to
  create an almost omnipresent power to be controlled by Rome alone. Has
  not the exercise of it been exemplified in the inquisition? Was it not
  felt in the massacre of St. Bartholomew? I will not stop to ask the power
  and control of a Madame Maintenon, or Du Barry: nor whose influences
  controlled them. Does not all history portray their one effort?</p>

  <p>But has not the Church of England endeavored to obtain temporal power,
  also, by interference in the affairs of this world, politically?</p>

  <p>Shame! shame!! If the priesthood are honest in giving an undivided
  allegiance to <span class="sc">Him</span>, whom they <!-- Page 109
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>[109]</span>have taken an
  oath <i>only</i> to serve; and yet, whose "kingdom is not of this world;"
  how dare they violate that obligation? "<i>Ne sutor ultra crepidam,</i>"
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>But we in the United States are not better than our neighbors. Man is
  the same everywhere, but for education.</p>

  <p>And this brings us to the great, practical lesson, to which end all
  that has thus far been detailed has been directed.</p>

  <p>Americans! no matter of what nation you came, consider this
  lesson.</p>

  <p>We have ignored and thrown aside the priestly fable of an anointment
  by a man conferring an hereditary right to rule his brother man, by any
  family. This <i>jus divinum regum</i> is an absurdity, practically
  discarded by those who assert it. What divine right has been granted
  either to Napoleon the Great, or to Napoleon the little? Whence came it?
  By whose hands? How is it preserved? Is not the same religious power
  ready to crown a Bourbon one day, and, in spite of the hereditary <i>jus
  divinum</i> already granted, crown a Corsican (who has waded through
  blood to his throne) the next day; over the very rights of the Bourbon,
  who relies on that <i>jus divinum</i> as his title?</p>

  <p>A divine right (if any) is here granted to both&mdash;to the Bourbon,
  and to the Corsican. Can truth contradict itself? If there be a
  contradiction must there not be error somewhere? <!-- Page 110 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>[110]</span></p>

  <p>This <i>jus divinum</i> that began with the deification of Nimrod, is
  still perpetuated though in other hands.</p>

  <p>But we must look into this a little further.</p>

  <p>II. Although the Theocracy in the days of Moses was of temporary
  duration, and human power afterward asserted a kingly right, was that
  divine right ever preserved? If divine, it is immutable. Does history
  show this? When Titus conquered Jerusalem, does not Jewish history tell
  us the voice was heard saying, "<span class="sc">Let us go
  hence</span>?"</p>

  <p>III. History shows, among men, two classes who have governed
  others:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Kings, emperors, and rulers.</p>

  <p>2. Priests and clergy, controlling the superstitious feelings of
  mankind; yes, even these kings, emperors, and rulers, by mysticism.</p>

  <p>IV. There have been throughout history two classes of secret
  societies.</p>

  <p>One always endeavoring to govern and control the masses politically,
  by religious mysteries, &amp;c. The other endeavoring to persuade to the
  study of science and philosophy, and trying to wean men from the mere
  struggle of this world's power, to a preparation for another world, into
  which we must be born spiritually, by human death, and as to which this
  earth is only the school-house. And this class has not interfered in any
  manner with politics in any country. <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>[111]</span></p>

  <p>This bring us to the present condition of our own beloved country at
  this time.</p>

  <p>A secret society, also political, was formed here, known as <span
  class="sc">the Know-Nothings</span>. And its secrecy was about to destroy
  it, when that secrecy, under the power of the press, vanished into
  mist.</p>

  <p>But what was the origin thereof? And when, after gentlemen and
  statesmen controlled it, and expelled its rubbish, it assumed a powerful
  influence, and a new form, as an "American Party," what were the deep
  moving causes which led to its prominent position?</p>

  <p>From the days of Nimrod to the present day, all history shows an
  effort on the part of a few to control temporal power, at the expense of
  the many. They have always acted on the superstitions of man to
  accomplish this end.</p>

  <p>But the American theory (<i>esto perpetua</i>) is, that all men are
  free and equal in their political rights, when their intellect is that of
  control, not of servitude; and that the people are the source and
  fountain of political power. It cometh not from a priest. It is the voice
  of freemen speaking and acting through their agents, whom they
  select.</p>

  <p>This antagonism is now to be severely tested in coming history.</p>

  <p>What is the source of temporal power?</p>

  <p>Rome, England, France, and other countries, say it is from "the
  church," meaning their own particular <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>[112]</span>designation of a
  religion. That it is a divine right communicated by priestly anointment,
  attended by public ceremonies, imposing in appearance, and "<i>ad
  captandum,</i>" for the public eye.</p>

  <p>The American theory, going far beyond the bare and imperfect teaching
  of Pythagoras, boldly asserts what is believed to be the true and only
  origin of temporal power, the free will of a people exercised through
  agents of its own selection.</p>

  <p>For about eighty years past this first great experiment has been
  successful. But that success has induced the most insidious attacks of
  those who advocate the opposite policy. We must be watchful, or our
  liberties will be gone. The game they now play is new in history; but, it
  is one easily comprehended. It has been well said that the price of
  liberty is eternal vigilance.</p>

  <p>But two centuries since this land was the home of the savage. The
  Caucasian intellect, however, has assumed its supremacy here; and the
  Indian, incapable of mental culture, is gradually, but surely passing,
  like other forms of animal existence, from the world.</p>

  <p>One of the highest efforts of the human mind, is the Constitution of
  the United States of America. The great principles of freemen governing
  themselves, as there enunciated, must and will necessarily be attacked by
  the asserters of divine right in temporal government. If our experiment
  succeeds the powers of Europe must fall, or undergo an entire change.
  <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page113"></a>[113]</span>England's nobility must acknowledge,
  sooner or later, the equality of the commonalty and gentry with
  themselves. Distinctions in France have already gone, except as to the
  assertion of the power of an emperor by virtue of a priestly
  coronation.</p>

  <p>The popular masses of Europe have only displayed their first, but, as
  yet, imperfect efforts to assert their political rights. It is the reflex
  action of the great principle we have successfully, thus far, practised.
  And will not the powers who have conquered the masses then thus far, use
  every effort to destroy this experiment of ours and perpetuate thereby
  their own existence? If we continue to succeed, our lesson to the world
  is the death-knell of monarchy and imperial power. Foreign powers and
  priestly powers are making this effort. And if we are doomed to fail, it
  will be by the <span class="scac">DISUNION</span> their emissaries here
  endeavor to produce. With us, again, is religious influence exerted.
  Servitude is recognised and practised in the south. But the clergy of the
  north have commenced a fanatical crusade against it. We should guard well
  against these influences, foreign and domestic, now operating against
  us.</p>

  <p>As a part of the history of the times, it may be proper to give the
  rise and progress of the so-called order of "Know-Nothings." The plan of
  the organization was conceived by a gentleman of the city of New York,
  who, in 1849, prepared and embodied into a system, a plan for uniting the
  American <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>[114]</span>sentiment of the American people
  throughout the United States. It was meant as a combined resistance, on
  the part of the native American population, to foreign and papal
  influence in this country. The progress of the plan was so slow in its
  development, that at the end of two years, the number of members uniting
  in the organization did not exceed thirty. In 1852 the plan was examined
  by a few gentlemen connected with the Order of United Americans, another
  secret and American organization, but not directly political or partisan
  in its aims and objects. A society was formed, and forty-three members
  signed their names to it, and from that small beginning was formed a body
  of native Americans which, in a year or two after, exceeded, in the state
  of New York alone, two hundred thousand members. This state organization
  soon extended its ramifications all over the country, and is now known as
  the American party. It has held three national conventions, one in
  Philadelphia, one at New York, and one in Louisville, and is now no more
  of a secret party than either of the two great parties opposed to it: the
  national conventions having abolished all secret meetings, and the state
  conventions or councils having generally concurred in this abolition of
  all oaths and all forms of obligation but those of personal honor and
  mutual good faith.</p>

  <p>The ban of secrecy had made it, doubtless, an object of suspicion. Its
  adversaries hurl at it these <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>[115]</span>unfortunate antecedents. But now all
  secrecy has been abolished, and the party claims to assert only, the
  great principle of an <span class="scac">INTELLIGENT
  SELF-GOVERNMENT</span>. They recognise the secret and insidious
  influences of the Jesuit, and deprecate it. They call attention to it,
  and to its increasing importance in this valley; but still, in the spirit
  of liberty, leave the Jesuit free to act as he pleases. They perceive
  that it is irreconcilable with freedom of thought and conscience to
  surrender, unconditionally, one's own views and thoughts to the will of
  any one man, whether he be at Rome or elsewhere. Still he is not
  interfered with. Let him act with all freedom. You can vote for him for
  office or not, as you please; and, here, we have reason to fear the
  secret influence controlled alone at Rome. But, with all this freedom, it
  is called "persecution" to say "I will not vote for such a man."</p>

  <p>Let Europe send over all her emissaries, and our country tells them
  you shall have the protection of our flag. You shall think, and speak
  what you will, if it be not to the injury of your neighbor. But is there
  not a spirit of self-preservation which demands that eternal vigilance
  which is the price of freedom? Is it "proscription" in saying to another
  man, "I will not vote for you?" If you can not exercise your own will,
  where is your freedom? If a whig refuses to vote for a democrat is that
  "proscription?"</p>

  <p>Then, if I believe another man has surrendered his <!-- Page 116
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>[116]</span>own will to
  the unconditional control of another, in a foreign country, can I trust
  him&mdash;regarding the antecedents hereinbefore referred to?</p>

  <p>It has been said, perhaps unjustly (at least I hope so), that the
  teaching of this important society, the Jesuit, so deeply-rooted here,
  is, that "the end justifies the means." If this be so, and if they can
  exercise over the immigrant population from Europe the power imputed to
  them&mdash;all this also controlled at Rome by the general of the order
  and his monitor&mdash;where can freedom be preserved to us, if they can
  control a majority of votes here? In such case our liberties are gone. In
  such case, they have simply adopted and ingeniously carried out the
  ancient powers of the priestly Magi.</p>

  <p>Has not an Englishman, a member of parliament, come to this country,
  and lectured in New England on the abolition of slavery, expressly to aid
  in creating disunion of our states?</p>

  <p>Has not the leaven of Puritanism been excited to new action to
  accomplish the same result?</p>

  <p>Have not three thousand clergymen been induced to interfere in our
  temporal and political affairs; just as in past history we find the Magi
  and the priests did?</p>

  <p>Has not the word of God been set at naught? Where the command is,
  "Thou shalt not kill," are not Sharpe's rifles purchased by their
  command?</p>

  <p>A clever book of fiction, written by a fanatical old <!-- Page 117
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[117]</span>woman,
  although untrue even as a picture of southern society, has obtained for
  her the cordial entrée of British aristocracy.</p>

  <p>Then, again, regard the immense immigration from Europe. No sooner is
  it possible, but we find politicians busy to influence them, and obtain
  their votes. And they chiefly are opposed to slavery.</p>

  <p>As patriots, Americans should say, you may vote. We throw around you
  no restraint. Your home is our home. You are in every sense a brother,
  and you shall be deprived of no privilege. But while in no manner the
  privileges of a freeman should be denied to any, we must not shut our
  eyes to the influences that surround us.</p>

  <p>The Magi controlled the then known world.</p>

  <p>The Roman church has done the same. In England a church has assumed
  secular power.</p>

  <p>In each instance it was the fabulous <i>jus divinum</i> by which it
  was accomplished.</p>

  <p>Shall they be allowed by such influences to control and so break down
  our great experiment of self-government?</p>

  <p>Rather let those peaceful and benevolent influences prevail, which
  were inculcated by societies who taught equality of rights, and peace and
  charity among men.</p>

  <p>This bring us then to the great motive power which alone can save our
  country.</p>

  <p>It is <i>the education of the people, and the freedom of the press,
  directed through a unity of language</i>. <!-- Page 118 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>[118]</span>Through these, if
  properly conducted, unless they be controlled by the hostile influences
  hereinbefore spoken of, we shall be a happy and united nation.</p>

  <p>There is no need, hereafter, of any secret teaching. Secret societies
  may promote social good, but they are no longer necessary to teach either
  traditional philosophy, or promote public welfare, except by
  benevolence.</p>

  <p>Our duty is to encourage thought, foster public schools, create a
  unity of feeling and ideas, by means of a unity of language, and a
  freedom of the press.</p>

  <p>But, in doing so, from the history of the past, can we be too careful
  in guarding against the insidious influences of societies, whose
  antecedents in history have proved so dangerous?</p>

  <p>Societies having for their object a religious influence, and, thereby
  intending to control political power, are dangerous. The past has shown
  it.</p>

  <p>Societies of benevolence, like the Free-Masons and Odd-Fellows, have
  done much good; but each member therein votes, in political matters, as
  he pleases, and without control. These societies do good to all, without
  view to any particular faith.</p>

  <p>Each person that binds himself, by an obligation, to serve only <span
  class="sc">Him</span>, whose "kingdom is not of this world," should be
  debarred thereby from interfering in the politics of this world, which he
  has thus forsworn.</p>

  <p>But what are the facts? Do not even the clergy <!-- Page 119 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>[119]</span>of New England try to
  control our government? Are they not even endeavoring to create <span
  class="scac">DISUNION</span>? Is this not with the desire and
  <i>empressement</i> of foreign power?</p>

  <p>How far may not the prætorian bands of Rome aid therein to carry out
  the result?</p>

  <p>Can we be too guarded as to our great experiment?</p>

  <p>The first practical result, then, indicated by past history, is, that
  political power, in monarchies, empires, &amp;c., has been under the
  control of mere priestly mysteries.</p>

  <p>The next is, that human nature is always the same, and will endeavor
  to accomplish the same result.</p>

  <p>Take the history of the past, what are we to anticipate for the
  future? Can we judge but from the past? Have they not endeavored to
  govern Europe?</p>

  <p>We can only allow the will of freemen to govern us. The will that has,
  on oath, submitted itself to the control of a foreign power, is not that
  of a <i>free man</i>, and our duty is to watch it.</p>

  <p>Let, then, every secret become a mystery; or, a revealed secret. If it
  be good to one, let it be good to all. Secure equality of rights.
  Collision of mind strikes out the sparks of truth. Secure universal
  education by free schools, ensuring unity of language, but leaving
  thought free; and the result will be, that secrecy will have become a
  mystery, or revealed knowledge to all.</p>

  <p>Education, and the freedom of the press, are the <!-- Page 120
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[120]</span>true
  safeguards of a republic. Interfere with the exercise of no religion; but
  let no one system of faith control your government. Frown down every
  effort of priests or clergy to meddle with politics. Then shall we avoid
  the errors of the past, preserve our present union, and hope for the
  spread of the true principles of liberty. With education will be united
  true piety, each assisting the other, no matter what the peculiar system
  of faith. Do away with secrecy altogether, and let every blessing that
  knowledge can confer, be devoted to public information, and the good of
  all. So, shall the abuses of secrecy be done away with for ever&mdash;and
  it shine forth only in the holy sphere to which it should be confined, to
  modesty and domestic virtue, religious meditation and prayer, and
  prudence in the transactions of life.</p>

  the marginal for the text reading of the passage, and the reason for it
  is this: The above is a clear historical account of those who journeyed
  to the plains of Shinar, which were only the descendants of Cush the
  father of Nimrod; though Asshur is said to have gone and builded the city
  of Nineveh, with the others mentioned in the text&mdash;which Asshur was
  one of the sons of Shem, who perhaps was blended by marriage, or other
  connections, with his relations the sons of Ham, unless it can be shown
  that there was one of that name in Ham's descendants as well as Shem's
  son. It was something particular (if correct) that Moses should bring in
  Asshur into his account of Ham's issue, because he was very strict in
  giving such relations of Japheth and Shem in their own places. Would
  Noah, who was so much disgusted at his son Ham as to curse him, permit
  the children of his other sons, whom he blessed, to have any
  communication with his children? Bishop Cumberland, in the last century,
  took some pains to unravel this, and concluded that the marginal
  translation in our bibles is the right one&mdash;that in the text being,
  "Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh", &amp;c.; that
  in the margin, "And he [Nimrod] went out of that land into
  Assyria"&mdash;for Asshur generally in scripture signifies <i>the
  Assyrian</i>, excepting only in the genealogies: and in support of this
  he brings forward many authentic testimonies. (See Parsons's Remains of
